        "Authors": "Tam Nguyen, Tan M. Nguyen, Richard G. Baraniuk",
        "Abstract": "Transformers have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of natural language processing and computer vision applications. However, the representation capacity of a deep transformer model is degraded due to the over-smoothing issue in which the token representations become identical when the model's depth grows. In this work, we show that self-attention layers in transformers minimize a functional which promotes smoothness, thereby causing token uniformity. We then propose a novel regularizer that penalizes the norm of the difference between the smooth output tokens from self-attention and the input tokens to preserve the fidelity of the tokens. Minimizing the resulting regularized energy functional, we derive the Neural Transformer with a Regularized Nonlocal Functional (NeuTRENO), a novel class of transformer models that can mitigate the over-smoothing issue. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of NeuTRENO over the baseline transformers and state-of-the-art methods in reducing the over-smoothing of token representations on various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling.",

        "Abstract": "Meta-learning is a powerful approach that exploits historical data to quickly solve new tasks from the same distribution. In the low-data regime, methods based on the closed-form posterior of Gaussian processes (GP) together with Bayesian optimization have achieved high performance. However, these methods are either computationally expensive or introduce assumptions that hinder a principled propagation of uncertainty between task models. This may disrupt the balance between exploration and exploitation during optimization. In this paper, we develop ScaML-GP, a modular GP model for meta-learning that is scalable in the number of tasks. Our core contribution is a carefully designed multi-task kernel that enables hierarchical training and task scalability. Conditioning ScaML-GP on the meta-data exposes its modular nature yielding a test-task prior that combines the posteriors of meta-task GPs. In synthetic and real-world meta-learning experiments, we demonstrate that ScaML-GP can learn efficiently both with few and many meta-tasks.",

        "Abstract": "This study comprehensively evaluates tuning methods for autofocal glasses using virtual reality (VR), addressing the challenge of presbyopia. With aging, presbyopia diminishes the eye's ability to focus on nearby objects, impacting the quality of life for billions. Autofocals, employing focus-tunable lenses, dynamically adjust optical power for each fixation, promising a more natural visual experience than traditional bifocal or multifocal lenses. Our research contrasts the most common tuning methods - manual, gaze-based, and vergence - within a VR setup to mimic real-world scenarios. Utilizing the XTAL VR headset equipped with eye-tracking, the study replicated autofocal scenarios, measuring performance and usability through psychophysical tasks and NASA TLX surveys. Results show varying strengths and weaknesses across methods, with gaze control excelling in precision but not necessarily comfort and manual control providing stability and predictability. The findings guide the selection of tuning methods based on task requirements and user preferences, highlighting a balance between precision and ease of use.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a driving force in transforming various domains, reshaping the artificial general intelligence landscape. However, the increasing computational and memory demands of these models present substantial challenges, hindering both academic research and practical applications. To address these issues, a wide array of methods, including both algorithmic and hardware solutions, have been developed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of algorithmic advancements aimed at improving LLM efficiency. Unlike other surveys that typically focus on specific areas such as training or model compression, this paper examines the multi-faceted dimensions of efficiency essential for the end-to-end algorithmic development of LLMs. Specifically, it covers various topics related to efficiency, including scaling laws, data utilization, architectural innovations, training and tuning strategies, and inference techniques. This paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, laying the groundwork for future innovations in this critical research area.

        "Authors": "Kangcheng Liu, Yong-Jin Liu, Kai Tang, Ming Liu, Baoquan Chen",
        "Abstract": "Deep neural network models have achieved remarkable progress in 3D scene understanding while trained in the closed-set setting and with full labels. However, the major bottleneck for current 3D recognition approaches is that they do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse kinds of real-world applications. In the meantime, current state-of-the-art 3D scene understanding approaches primarily require high-quality labels to train neural networks, which merely perform well in a fully supervised manner. This work presents a generalized and simple framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To leverage the boundary information, we propose a novel energy-based loss with boundary awareness benefiting from the region-level boundary predictions. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. Extensive experiments with both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in both data-efficient learning and open-world few-shot learning.

The problem is motivated by the study of peer learning in human educational systems. In this context, we study natural knowledge diffusion processes in networks of interacting artificial learners. By `natural', we mean processes that reflect human peer learning where the students' internal state and learning process is mostly opaque, and the main degree of freedom lies in the formation of peer learning groups by a coordinator who can potentially evaluate the learners before assigning them to peer groups. Among else, we empirically show that such processes indeed make effective use of the training resources, and enable the design of modular neural models that have the capacity to generalize without being prone to overfitting noisy labels.",

MaxMem uses an application-agnostic and lightweight memory occupancy control mechanism based on fast memory miss ratios to provide application QoS under increasing colocation. By relying on memory access sampling and binning to quickly identify per-process memory heat gradients, MaxMem maximizes performance for many applications sharing tiered main memory simultaneously. MaxMem is designed as a user-space memory manager to be easily modifiable and extensible, without complex kernel code development. On a system with tiered main memory consisting of DRAM and Intel Optane persistent memory modules, our evaluation confirms that MaxMem provides 11% and 38% better throughput and up to 80% and an order of magnitude lower 99th percentile latency than HeMem and Linux AutoNUMA, respectively, with a Big Data key-value store in dynamic colocation scenarios.",

        "Authors": "Michail Tarasiou, Jiankang Deng, Stefanos Zafeiriou",
        "Abstract": "Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) involves the intricate task of matching face images across the visual domains of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR). While much of the existing literature on HFR identifies the domain gap as a primary challenge and directs efforts towards bridging it at either the input or feature level, our work deviates from this trend. We observe that large neural networks, unlike their smaller counterparts, when pre-trained on large scale homogeneous VIS data, demonstrate exceptional zero-shot performance in HFR, suggesting that the domain gap might be less pronounced than previously believed. By approaching the HFR problem as one of low-data fine-tuning, we introduce a straightforward framework: comprehensive pre-training, succeeded by a regularized fine-tuning strategy, that matches or surpasses the current state-of-the-art on four publicly available benchmarks.

Although at the exploration level, some methods are proposed to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, such as tempering, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Rao-redwellization, and scalable methods for better performance, it cannot avoid the stochastic nature of this exploration. We consider the target distribution as a mapping where the infinite-dimensional Eulerian space of the parameters consists of a number of deterministic submanifolds and propose a generalized energy metric, termed weighted Riesz energy, where a number of points is generated through pairwise interactions, to discretize rectifiable submanifolds. We study the properties of the point, called Riesz particle, and embed it into sequential MCMC, and we find that there will be higher acceptance rates with fewer evaluations, we validate it through experimental comparative analysis from a linear Gaussian state-space model with synthetic data and a non-linear stochastic volatility model with real-world data.",

        "Authors": "David V. Nguyen, Edward F. Melcer, Deanne Adams",
        "Abstract": "Research suggests there is a perception that females and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities have worse gameplay skills and produce less engaging video game streaming content. This bias might impact streamers' audience size, viewers' financial patronage of a streamer, streamers' sponsorship offers, etc. However, few studies on this topic use experimental methods. To fill this gap, we conducted a between-subjects survey experiment to examine if viewers are biased against video game streamers based on the streamer's gender or race/ethnicity. 200 survey participants rated the gameplay skill and viewer engagement of an identical gameplay recording. The only change between experimental conditions was the streamer's name who purportedly created the recording. The Dunnett's test found no statistically significant differences in viewer engagement ratings when comparing White male streamers to either White female (p = 0.37), Latino male (p = 0.66), or Asian male (p = 0.09) streamers. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in gameplay skill ratings when comparing White male streamers to either White female (p = 0.10), Latino male (p = 1.00), or Asian male (p = 0.59) streamers. Potential contributors to statistically non-significant results and counter-intuitive results (i.e., White females received non-significantly higher ratings than White males) are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Normalization techniques have been widely used in the field of deep learning due to their capability of enabling higher learning rates and are less careful in initialization. However, the effectiveness of popular normalization technologies is typically limited to specific areas. Unlike the standard Batch Normalization (BN) and Layer Normalization (LN), where BN computes the mean and variance along the (N,H,W) dimensions and LN computes the mean and variance along the (C,H,W) dimensions (N, C, H and W are the batch, channel, spatial height and width dimension, respectively), this paper presents a novel normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN). To exploit both the channel and batch dependence and adaptively and combine the advantages of BN and LN based on specific datasets or tasks, BCN separately normalizes inputs along the (N, H, W) and (C, H, W) axes, then combines the normalized outputs based on adaptive parameters. As a basic block, BCN can be easily integrated into existing models for various applications in the field of computer vision. Empirical results show that the proposed technique can be seamlessly applied to various versions of CNN or Vision Transformer architecture.

        "Authors": "Aleksi Knuutila",
        "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel application of Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) to study visual aspects of social processes. I train a a StyleGAN2-model on a custom dataset of 14,564 images of London, sourced from Google Streetview taken in London. After training, I invert the images in the training set, finding points in the model's latent space that correspond to them, and compare results from three inversion techniques. I connect each data point with metadata from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, describing income, health and environmental quality in the area where the photographs were taken. It is then possible to map which parts of the model's latent space encode visual features that are distinctive for health, income and environmental quality, and condition the synthesis of new images based on these factors. The synthetic images created reflect visual features of social processes that were previously unknown and difficult to study, describing recurring visual differences between deprived and privileged areas in London. GANs are known for their capability to produce a continuous range of images that exhibit visual differences. The paper tests how to exploit this ability through visual comparisons in still images as well as through an interactive website where users can guide image synthesis with sliders. Though conditioned synthesis has its limitations and the results are difficult to validate, the paper points to the potential for generative models to be repurposed to be parts of social scientific methods.",

Although the current method demonstrates the possibility of quantum k-means clustering, it does not ensure high accuracy and consistency across a wide range of datasets. The existing coreset techniques are designed for classical algorithms and there has been no quantum-tailored coreset technique which is designed to boost the accuracy of quantum algorithms. In this work, we propose solving the k-means clustering problem with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and a customised coreset method, the Contour coreset, which has been formulated with specific focus on quantum algorithms. Extensive simulations with synthetic and real-life data demonstrated that our VQE+Contour Coreset approach outperforms existing QAOA+Coreset k-means clustering approaches with higher accuracy and lower standard deviation. Our work has shown that quantum tailored coreset techniques has the potential to significantly boost the performance of quantum algorithms when compared to using generic off-the-shelf coreset techniques.",

Under these free transformations, we show that logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

        "Abstract": "Fake news on social media has large, negative implications for society. However, little is known about what linguistic cues make people fall for fake news and, hence, how to design effective countermeasures for social media. In this study, we seek to understand which linguistic cues make people fall for fake news. Linguistic cues (e.g., adverbs, personal pronouns, positive emotion words, negative emotion words) are important characteristics of any text and also affect how people process real vs. fake news. Specifically, we compare the role of linguistic cues across both cognitive processing (related to careful thinking) and affective processing (related to unconscious automatic evaluations). To this end, we performed a within-subject experiment where we collected neurophysiological measurements of 42 subjects while these read a sample of 40 real and fake news articles. During our experiment, we measured cognitive processing through eye fixations, and affective processing in situ through heart rate variability. We find that users engage more in cognitive processing for longer fake news articles, while affective processing is more pronounced for fake news written in analytic words. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the role of linguistic cues in fake news processing. Altogether, our findings have important implications for designing online platforms that encourage users to engage in careful thinking and thus prevent them from falling for fake news.",

        "Abstract": "This paper considers stochastic-constrained stochastic optimization where the stochastic constraint is to satisfy that the expectation of a random function is below a certain threshold. In particular, we study the setting where data samples are drawn from a Markov chain and thus are not independent and identically distributed. We generalize the drift-plus-penalty framework, a primal-dual stochastic gradient method developed for the i.i.d. case, to the Markov chain sampling setting. We propose two variants of drift-plus-penalty; one is for the case when the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain is known while the other is for the case of unknown mixing time. In fact, our algorithms apply to a more general setting of constrained online convex optimization where the sequence of constraint functions follows a Markov chain. Both algorithms are adaptive in that the first works without knowledge of the time horizon while the second uses AdaGrad-style algorithm parameters, which is of independent interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on classification with fairness constraints.",

        "Authors": "Zilin Du, Haoxin Li, Xu Guo, Boyang Li",
        "Abstract": "The task of multimodal relation extraction has attracted significant research attention, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of available training data. One natural thought is to extend existing datasets with cross-modal generative models. In this paper, we consider a novel problem setting, where only unimodal data, either text or image, are available during training. We aim to train a multimodal classifier from synthetic data that perform well on real multimodal test data. However, training with synthetic data suffers from two obstacles: lack of data diversity and label information loss. To alleviate the issues, we propose Mutual Information-aware Multimodal Iterated Relational dAta GEneration (MI2RAGE), which applies Chained Cross-modal Generation (CCG) to promote diversity in the generated data and exploits a teacher network to select valuable training samples with high mutual information with the ground-truth labels. Comparing our method to direct training on synthetic data, we observed a significant improvement of 24.06% F1 with synthetic text and 26.42% F1 with synthetic images. Notably, our best model trained on completely synthetic images outperforms prior state-of-the-art models trained on real multimodal data by a margin of 3.76% in F1. Our codebase will be made available upon acceptance.",

The proposed mechanism simplifies the RIS regulation matrix, by decomposing the electromagnetic wave regulation process into two sub-processes: virtual receiving response and virtual regular transmission, which leads to the decoupling of the RIS cascaded channel. This article further discusses the concrete implementation of the proposed channel decoupling mechanism in two scenarios of single-user access and multi-user access, and gives the corresponding detailed scheme. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel decoupling scheme is a low-complexity and effective solution for resolving the RIS regulation matrix.",

        "Abstract": "Digital health, including telemedicine, has increased access to abortion care. The convenience, flexibility of appointment times, and ensured privacy to abortion users may make abortion services via telemedicine preferable. This scoping review systematically mapped studies conducted on abortion services via telemedicine, including their effectiveness and acceptability for abortion users and providers. All published papers included abortion services via telemedicine in the United States were considered. Articles were searched in PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases in September 2022. The findings were synthesized narratively, and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines were used to report this study. Out of 757 retrieved articles, 33 articles were selected based on the inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2011 and 2022, with 24 published in the last 3 years. The study found that telemedicine increased access to abortion care in the United States, especially for people in remote areas or those worried about stigma from in-person visits. The effectiveness of abortion services via telemedicine was comparable to in-clinic visits, with 6% or fewer abortions requiring surgical intervention. Both care providers and abortion seekers expressed positive perceptions of telemedicine-based abortion services. However, abortion users reported mixed emotions, with some preferring in-person visits. The most common reasons for choosing telemedicine included the distance to the abortion clinic, convenience, privacy, cost, flexibility of appointment times, and state laws imposing waiting periods or restrictive policies. Telemedicine offered a preferable option for abortion seekers and providers. The feasibility of accessing abortion services via telemedicine in low-resource settings needs further investigation.",

While achieving impressive performance on small synthetic scenes, these methods often suffer from oversmoothed reconstructions, especially for complex real-world scenes. In this work, we introduce DNS SLAM, a novel neural RGB-D semantic SLAM approach featuring a hybrid representation. Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware. Further, our method outputs class-wise decomposed reconstructions with better texture capturing appearance and geometric details.",

        "Abstract": "To ensure the usefulness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real systems, it is crucial to ensure they are robust to noise and adversarial attacks. In adversarial RL, an external attacker has the power to manipulate the victim agent's interaction with the environment. We study the full class of online manipulation attacks, which include (i) state attacks, (ii) observation attacks (which are a generalization of perceived-state attacks), (iii) action attacks, and (iv) reward attacks. We show the attacker's problem of designing a stealthy attack that maximizes its own expected reward, which often corresponds to minimizing the victim's value, is captured by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that we call a meta-MDP since it is not the true environment but a higher level environment induced by the attacked interaction. We show that the attacker can derive optimal attacks by planning in polynomial time or learning with polynomial sample complexity using standard RL techniques. We argue that the optimal defense policy for the victim can be computed as the solution to a stochastic Stackelberg game, which can be further simplified into a partially-observable turn-based stochastic game (POTBSG). Neither the attacker nor the victim would benefit from deviating from their respective optimal policies, thus such solutions are truly robust. Although the defense problem is NP-hard, we show that optimal Markovian defenses can be computed (learned) in polynomial time (sample complexity) in many scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed representations provide a vector space that captures meaningful relationships between data instances. The distributed nature of these representations, however, entangles together multiple attributes or concepts of data instances (e.g., the topic or sentiment of a text, characteristics of the author (age, gender, etc), etc). Recent work has proposed the task of concept erasure, in which rather than making a concept predictable, the goal is to remove an attribute from distributed representations while retaining other information from the original representation space as much as possible. In this paper, we propose a new distance metric learning-based objective, the Kernelized Rate-Distortion Maximizer (KRaM), for performing concept erasure. KRaM fits a transformation of representations to match a specified distance measure (defined by a labeled concept to erase) using a modified rate-distortion function. Specifically, KRaM's objective function aims to make instances with similar concept labels dissimilar in the learned representation space while retaining other information. We find that optimizing KRaM effectively erases various types of concepts: categorical, continuous, and vector-valued variables from data representations across diverse domains. We also provide a theoretical analysis of several properties of KRaM's objective. To assess the quality of the learned representations, we propose an alignment score to evaluate their similarity with the original representation space. Additionally, we conduct experiments to showcase KRaM's efficacy in various settings, from erasing binary gender variables in word embeddings to vector-valued variables in GPT-3 representations.",

        "Abstract": "Modeling the interactions between drugs, targets, and diseases is paramount in drug discovery and has significant implications for precision medicine and personalized treatments. Current approaches frequently consider drug-target or drug-disease interactions individually, ignoring the interdependencies among all three entities. Within human metabolic systems, drugs interact with protein targets in cells, influencing target activities and subsequently impacting biological pathways to promote healthy functions and treat diseases. Moving beyond binary relationships and exploring tighter triple relationships is essential to understanding drugs' mechanism of action (MoAs). Moreover, identifying the heterogeneity of drugs, targets, and diseases, along with their distinct characteristics, is critical to model these complex interactions appropriately. To address these challenges, we effectively model the interconnectedness of all entities in a heterogeneous graph and develop a novel Heterogeneous Graph Triplet Attention Network (\\texttt{HeTriNet}). \\texttt{HeTriNet} introduces a novel triplet attention mechanism within this heterogeneous graph structure. Beyond pairwise attention as the importance of an entity for the other one, we define triplet attention to model the importance of pairs for entities in the drug-target-disease triplet prediction problem. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that \\texttt{HeTriNet} outperforms several baselines, demonstrating its remarkable proficiency in uncovering novel drug-target-disease relationships.",

        "Authors": "Steven DiSilvio, Anthony Ozerov, Leon Zhou",
        "Abstract": "With the advent of power-meters allowing cyclists to precisely track their power outputs throughout the duration of a race, devising optimal power output strategies for races has become increasingly important in competitive cycling. To do so, the track, weather, and individual cyclist's abilities must all be considered. We propose differential equation models of fatigue and kinematics to simulate the performance of such strategies, and an innovative optimization algorithm to find the optimal strategy.\n  Our model for fatigue translates a cyclist's power curve (obtained by fitting the Omni-Power Duration Model to power curve data) into a differential equation to capture which power output strategies are feasible. Our kinematics model calculates the forces on the rider, and with power output models the cyclist's velocity and position via a system of differential equations. Using track data, including the slope of the track and velocity of the wind, the model accurately computes race times given a power output strategy on the exact track being raced.\n  To make power strategy optimization computationally tractable, we split the track into segments based on changes in slope and discretize the power output levels. As the space of possible strategies is large, we vectorize the differential equation model for efficient numerical integration of many simulations at once and develop a parallelized Tree Exploration with Monte-Carlo Evaluation algorithm. The algorithm is efficient, running in $O(ab\\sqrt{n})$ time and $O(n)$ space where $n$ is the number of simulations done for each choice, $a$ is the number of segments, and $b$ is the number of discrete power output levels.\n  We present results of this optimization for several different tracks and athletes. As an example, the model's time for Filippo Ganna in Tokyo 2020 differs from his real time by just 18%, supporting our model's efficacy.",

As a result of these climatic changes, the frequency of weather, climate, and water-related disasters has multiplied fivefold over the past 50 years, resulting in over 2 million deaths and losses exceeding $3.64 trillion USD. Leveraging AI-powered technologies for sustainable development and combating climate change is a promising avenue. Numerous significant publications are dedicated to using AI to improve renewable energy forecasting, enhance waste management, and monitor environmental changes in real time. However, very few research studies focus on making AI itself environmentally sustainable. This oversight regarding the sustainability of AI within the field might be attributed to a mindset gap and the absence of comprehensive energy datasets. In addition, with the ubiquity of edge AI systems and applications, especially on-device learning, there is a pressing need to measure, analyze, and optimize their environmental sustainability, such as energy efficiency. To this end, in this paper, we propose large-scale energy datasets for edge AI, named DeepEn2023, covering a wide range of kernels, state-of-the-art deep neural network models, and popular edge AI applications. We anticipate that DeepEn2023 will improve transparency in sustainability in on-device deep learning across a range of edge AI systems and applications.

        "Authors": "Bonifaz Stuhr",
        "Abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning aims at finding methods that learn representations from data without annotation-based signals. Abstaining from annotations not only leads to economic benefits but may - and to some extent already does - result in advantages regarding the representation's structure, robustness, and generalizability to different tasks. In the long run, unsupervised methods are expected to surpass their supervised counterparts due to the reduction of human intervention and the inherently more general setup that does not bias the optimization towards an objective originating from specific annotation-based signals. While major advantages of unsupervised representation learning have been recently observed in natural language processing, supervised methods still dominate in vision domains for most tasks. In this dissertation, we contribute to the field of unsupervised (visual) representation learning from three perspectives: (i) Learning representations: We design unsupervised, backpropagation-free Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) that utilize self-organization- and Hebbian-based learning rules to learn convolutional kernels and masks to achieve deeper backpropagation-free models. (ii) Evaluating representations: We build upon the widely used (non-)linear evaluation protocol to define pretext- and target-objective-independent metrics for measuring and investigating the objective function mismatch between various unsupervised pretext tasks and target tasks. (iii) Transferring representations: We contribute CARLANE, the first 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection, and a method based on prototypical self-supervised learning. Finally, we contribute a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that utilizes masks, global and local discriminators, and similarity sampling to mitigate content inconsistencies.",

        "Abstract": "We propose SparseDC, a model for Depth Completion of Sparse and non-uniform depth inputs. Unlike previous methods focusing on completing fixed distributions on benchmark datasets (e.g., NYU with 500 points, KITTI with 64 lines), SparseDC is specifically designed to handle depth maps with poor quality in real usage. The key contributions of SparseDC are two-fold. First, we design a simple strategy, called SFFM, to improve the robustness under sparse input by explicitly filling the unstable depth features with stable image features. Second, we propose a two-branch feature embedder to predict both the precise local geometry of regions with available depth values and accurate structures in regions with no depth. The key of the embedder is an uncertainty-based fusion module called UFFM to balance the local and long-term information extracted by CNNs and ViTs. Extensive indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate the robustness of our framework when facing sparse and non-uniform input depths. The pre-trained model and code are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/SparseDC.",

        "Abstract": "As pretrained text-to-image diffusion models become increasingly powerful, recent efforts have been made to distill knowledge from these text-to-image pretrained models for optimizing a text-guided 3D model. Most of the existing methods generate a holistic 3D model from a plain text input. This can be problematic when the text describes a complex scene with multiple objects, because the vectorized text embeddings are inherently unable to capture a complex description with multiple entities and relationships. Holistic 3D modeling of the entire scene further prevents accurate grounding of text entities and concepts. To address this limitation, we propose GraphDreamer, a novel framework to generate compositional 3D scenes from scene graphs, where objects are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges. By exploiting node and edge information in scene graphs, our method makes better use of the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is able to fully disentangle different objects without image-level supervision. To facilitate modeling of object-wise relationships, we use signed distance fields as representation and impose a constraint to avoid inter-penetration of objects. To avoid manual scene graph creation, we design a text prompt for ChatGPT to generate scene graphs based on text inputs. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of GraphDreamer in generating high-fidelity compositional 3D scenes with disentangled object entities.",

Consequently, a proper documentation of, and interdisciplinary discourse about a sonification is often hindered by terminology discrepancies between involved disciplines, i.e., the lack of a common sound terminology in sonification research. Without a common ground, a researcher from one discipline may have troubles understanding the implementation and imagining the resulting sound perception of a sonification, if the sonification is described by a researcher from another discipline. To find a common ground, I consulted literature on interdisciplinary research and discourse, identified problems that occur in sonification, and applied the recommended solutions. As a result, I recommend considering three aspects of sonification individually, namely 1.) Sound Design Concept, 2.) Objective and 3.) Method, clarifying which discipline is involved in which aspect, and sticking to this discipline's terminology. As two requirements of sonifications are that they are a) reproducible and b) interpretable, I recommend documenting and discussing every sonification design once using audio engineering terminology, and once using psychoacoustic terminology. The appendix provides comprehensive lists of sound terms from both disciplines, together with relevant literature and a clarification of often misunderstood and misused terms.",

        "Abstract": "Structure-based protein design has attracted increasing interest, with numerous methods being introduced in recent years. However, a universally accepted method for evaluation has not been established, since the wet-lab validation can be overly time-consuming for the development of new algorithms, and the $\\textit{in silico}$ validation with recovery and perplexity metrics is efficient but may not precisely reflect true foldability. To address this gap, we introduce two novel metrics: refoldability-based metric, which leverages high-accuracy protein structure prediction models as a proxy for wet lab experiments, and stability-based metric, which assesses whether models can assign high likelihoods to experimentally stable proteins. We curate datasets from high-quality CATH protein data, high-throughput $\\textit{de novo}$ designed proteins, and mega-scale experimental mutagenesis experiments, and in doing so, present the $\\textbf{PDB-Struct}$ benchmark that evaluates both recent and previously uncompared protein design methods. Experimental results indicate that ByProt, ProteinMPNN, and ESM-IF perform exceptionally well on our benchmark, while ESM-Design and AF-Design fall short on the refoldability metric. We also show that while some methods exhibit high sequence recovery, they do not perform as well on our new benchmark. Our proposed benchmark paves the way for a fair and comprehensive evaluation of protein design methods in the future. Code is available at https://github.com/WANG-CR/PDB-Struct.",

        "Authors": "Xu Chen, Zida Cheng, Jiangchao Yao, Chen Ju, Weilin Huang, Jinsong Lan, Xiaoyi Zeng, Shuai Xiao",
        "Abstract": "Cross-domain CTR (CDCTR) prediction is an important research topic that studies how to leverage meaningful data from a related domain to help CTR prediction in target domain. Most existing CDCTR works design implicit ways to transfer knowledge across domains such as parameter-sharing that regularizes the model training in target domain. More effectively, recent researchers propose explicit techniques to extract user interest knowledge and transfer this knowledge to target domain. However, the proposed method mainly faces two issues: 1) it usually requires a super domain, i.e. an extremely large source domain, to cover most users or items of target domain, and 2) the extracted user interest knowledge is static no matter what the context is in target domain. These limitations motivate us to develop a more flexible and efficient technique to explicitly transfer knowledge. In this work, we propose a cross-domain augmentation network (CDAnet) being able to perform explicit knowledge transfer between two domains. Specifically, CDAnet contains a designed translation network and an augmentation network which are trained sequentially. The translation network computes latent features from two domains and learns meaningful cross-domain knowledge of each input in target domain by using a designed cross-supervised feature translator. Later the augmentation network employs the explicit cross-domain knowledge as augmented information to boost the target domain CTR prediction. Through extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and one industrial production dataset, we show CDAnet can learn meaningful translated features and largely improve the performance of CTR prediction. CDAnet has been conducted online A/B test in image2product retrieval at Taobao app, bringing an absolute 0.11 point CTR improvement, a relative 0.64% deal growth and a relative 1.26% GMV increase.",

        "Abstract": "We study the statistical capacity of the classical binary perceptrons with general thresholds $Œ∫$. After recognizing the connection between the capacity and the bilinearly indexed (bli) random processes, we utilize a recent progress in studying such processes to characterize the capacity. In particular, we rely on \\emph{fully lifted} random duality theory (fl RDT) established in \\cite{Stojnicflrdt23} to create a general framework for studying the perceptrons' capacities. Successful underlying numerical evaluations are required for the framework (and ultimately the entire fl RDT machinery) to become fully practically operational. We present results obtained in that directions and uncover that the capacity characterizations are achieved on the second (first non-trivial) level of \\emph{stationarized} full lifting. The obtained results \\emph{exactly} match the replica symmetry breaking predictions obtained through statistical physics replica methods in \\cite{KraMez89}. Most notably, for the famous zero-threshold scenario, $Œ∫=0$, we uncover the well known $Œ±\\approx0.8330786$ scaled capacity.",

        "Abstract": "The booming use of text-to-image generative models has raised concerns about their high risk of producing copyright-infringing content. While probabilistic copyright protection methods provide a probabilistic guarantee against such infringement, in this paper, we introduce Virtually Assured Amplification Attack (VA3), a novel online attack framework that exposes the vulnerabilities of these protection mechanisms. The proposed framework significantly amplifies the probability of generating infringing content on the sustained interactions with generative models and a lower-bounded success probability of each engagement.

These action programs represent the motoric, perceptual, and structural aspects of action, and consist of sub-actions, pre- and post-conditions, and control flows. LEAP's action programs are centered on egocentric video and employ recent developments in LLMs both as a source for program knowledge and as an aggregator and assessor of multimodal video information. We apply LEAP over a majority (87\\%) of the training set of the EPIC Kitchens dataset, and release the resulting action programs as a publicly available dataset here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cpkw_TI1IIxXdzor0pOXG3rWJWuKU5Ex?usp=drive_link). We employ LEAP as a secondary source of supervision, using its action programs in a loss term applied to action recognition and anticipation networks. We demonstrate sizable improvements in performance in both tasks due to training with the LEAP dataset. Our method achieves 1st place on the EPIC Kitchens Action Recognition leaderboard as of November 17 among the networks restricted to RGB-input (see Supplementary Materials).",

We compare leading AI companies by research publications, citations, size of training runs, and contributions to algorithmic innovations. Our analysis reveals the substantial role played by Google, OpenAI and Meta. We find that these three companies have been responsible for some of the largest training runs, developed a large fraction of the algorithmic innovations that underpin large language models, and led in various metrics of citation impact. In contrast, leading Chinese companies such as Tencent and Baidu had a lower impact on many of these metrics compared to US counterparts. We observe many industry labs are pursuing large training runs, and that training runs from relative newcomers -- such as OpenAI and Anthropic -- have matched or surpassed those of long-standing incumbents such as Google. The data reveals a diverse ecosystem of companies steering AI progress, though US labs such as Google, OpenAI and Meta lead across critical metrics.",

The autoencoder pre-trained language models employed in the proposed systems are XLMV, InfoXLM-large, and XLMR-large. The evaluation utilizes Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients, assessing the relationship between machine-predicted quality scores and human judgments for 5 language pairs (English-Gujarati, English-Hindi, English-Marathi, English-Tamil and English-Telugu). The MonoTQ-InfoXLM-large approach emerges as a robust strategy, surpassing all other individual models proposed in this study by significantly improving over the baseline for the majority of the language pairs.",

Inspired by that humans develop their ability of understanding lengthy text from reading shorter text, we propose a simple yet effective summarization-based data augmentation, SUMMaug, for document classification. We first obtain easy-to-learn examples for the target document classification task by summarizing the input of the original training examples, while optionally merging the original labels to conform to the summarized input. We then use the generated pseudo examples to perform curriculum learning. Experimental results on two datasets confirmed the advantage of our method compared to existing baseline methods in terms of robustness and accuracy.

        "Abstract": "We consider the problem of learning causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using combinations of observational and interventional experimental data. Current methods tailored to this setting assume that interventions either destroy parent-child relations of the intervened (target) nodes or only alter such relations without modifying the parent sets, even when the intervention targets are unknown. We relax this assumption by proposing a Bayesian method for causal discovery from general interventions, which allow for modifications of the parent sets of the unknown targets. Even in this framework, DAGs and general interventions may be identifiable only up to some equivalence classes. We provide graphical characterizations of such interventional Markov equivalence and devise compatible priors for Bayesian inference that guarantee score equivalence of indistinguishable structures. We then develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to approximate the posterior distribution over DAGs, intervention targets and induced parent sets. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methodology on both simulated and real protein expression data.",

The space spanned by the IoUT nodes is three-dimensional, i.e., users are located in half-sphere centered at the AP placed at the bottom of a floating object at the water surface level. The analytical expressions for the system throughput and reliability expressed in terms of the outage probability are derived. Based on the simulated signal-to-noise-and-interference-ratio statistics and derived analytical expressions, we present numerical results that investigate the trade-off between the system performance and the IoUT system parameters, such as the number of users, activation probability and type of water medium. The presented conclusions provide valuable insights into the design of an SA-based solution for IoUT communications.",

We equip attack-defense trees with (trace) language semantics allowing to have an original dynamic interpretation of countermeasures. Interestingly, the expressiveness of attack-defense trees coincides with star-free languages, and the nested countermeasures impact the expressiveness of attack-defense trees. With an adequate notion of countermeasure-depth, we exhibit a strict hierarchy of the star-free languages that does not coincides with the classic one. Additionally, driven by the use of attack-defense trees in practice, we address the decision problems of trace membership and of non-emptiness, and study their computational complexities parameterized by the countermeasure-depth.",

        "Abstract": "We propose an innovative and generic methodology to analyse individual and collective behaviour through individual trajectory data. The work is motivated by the analysis of GPS trajectories of fishing vessels collected from regulatory tracking data in the context of marine biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-based fisheries management. We build a low-dimensional latent representation of trajectories using convolutional neural networks as non-linear mapping. This is done by training a conditional variational auto-encoder taking into account covariates. The posterior distributions of the latent representations can be linked to the characteristics of the actual trajectories. The latent distributions of the trajectories are compared with the Bhattacharyya coefficient, which is well-suited for comparing distributions. Using this coefficient, we analyse the variation of the individual behaviour of each vessel during time. For collective behaviour analysis, we build proximity graphs and use an extension of the stochastic block model for multiple networks. This model results in a clustering of the individuals based on their set of trajectories. The application to French fishing vessels enables us to obtain groups of vessels whose individual and collective behaviours exhibit spatio-temporal patterns over the period 2014-2018.",

However, high efficiency in existing NeRF-based few-shot view synthesis is often compromised to obtain an accurate 3D representation. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

In cases of large heterogeneous groups the procedure can be complemented by an auxiliary initial homogenization step, consisting of a clustering procedure in opinion space, leading to large homogeneous groups for which the aforementioned procedure will be applied.\n  The scheme is illustrated in examples motivated from environmental economics.",

High values of spin-orbit interaction (0.7 eV A) produce strong distortions of the optical activity polar curves that, differently, becomes rather isotropic if the experimental value (0.14 eV A) is used.",

The presence of anisotropy reduces the dynamical critical temperature, leading to the expected result that the critical temperature approaches zero in the full-anisotropy limit. We show that a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behavior of systems with quenched defects requires a generalized definition of the dynamic order parameter. By doing so, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quenched defects lowers the dynamic critical temperature as well, with a linear trend across the range of defect fractions considered. We also explore if and how it is possible to predict the dynamic behavior of specific magnetic systems with quenched randomness. Various geometric quantities, such as a quasi-electric defect potential, the defect dipole moment, and the properties of the defect Delaunay triangulation, prove useful for this purpose.",

        "Abstract": "Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high-purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre- and post-processing of a mask to produce structures. This paper presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal-organic precursor Au(acac)Me$_2$ locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD cycle without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 ¬∞C, over 200 K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of around 40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, they allow for the first time the precise determination of the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam.",

        "Abstract": "Information based thermodynamic logic is revisited. It consists of two parts: Part A applies the modern theory of probability in which an arbitrary convex function œÜis employed as an analytic \"device\" to express information as statistical dependency contained in the topological sub-œÉ-algebra structure. Via thermo-doubling, Fenchel-Young equality (FYE) that consists of œÜ(x) and its conjugate œà(y) establishes the notion of equilibrium between x and y through duality symmetry and the principle of maximum entropy/minimum free energy. Part B deals with a given set of repetitive measurements, where an inherent convex function emerges via the mathematics of large deviations. Logarithm-based Shannon entropy with œÜ(x)=-\\log x figures prominently for i.i.d. sample statistics. Information can be a measure of the agreement between a statistical observation and its theoretical models. Maximum likelihood principle arises here and FYE provides a thermodynamic energetic narrative of recurrent data.",

        "Abstract": "The Tavis-Cummings model is a paradigmatic central-mode model where a set of two-level quantum emitters (spins) are coupled to a collective cavity mode. Here we study the eigenstate spectrum, its localization properties and the effect on dynamics, focusing on the two-excitation sector relevant for nonlinear photonics. These models admit two sources of disorder: in the coupling between the spins and the cavity and in the energy shifts of the individual spins. While this model was known to be exactly solvable in the limit of a homogeneous coupling and inhomogeneous energy shifts, we here establish the solvability in the opposite limit of a homogeneous energy shift and inhomogeneous coupling, presenting the exact solution and corresponding conserved quantities. We identify three different classes of eigenstates, exhibiting different degrees of multifractality and semilocalization closely tied to the integrable points, and study their stability to perturbations away from these solvable points. The dynamics of the cavity occupation number away from equilibrium, exhibiting boson bunching and a two-photon blockade, is explicitly related to the localization properties of the eigenstates and illustrates how these models support a collective spin description despite the presence of disorder.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for state transfer under trace-preserving transformations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT). Under these free transformations, we show that logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

Of particular interest are single interface or Josephson Junction architectures involving Weyl semimetals, which are predicted to host odd parity, potentially topological, superconducting states. These expectations rely crucially on the tunneling of electronic states at the interface between the two systems. In this study, we revisit the question of induced superconductivity in an inversion broken WSM via quantum tunneling, treating the interface as an effective potential barrier. We determine the conditions under which the gap function couples to the Weyl physics and its properties within the WSM. Our simulations show that the mismatch in the nature of the low energy electronic states leads to a rapid decay of the superconductivity within the semi-metal.",

        "Abstract": "The elastic theory of chromonic liquid crystals is not completely established. We know, for example, that for anomalously low twist constants (needed for chromonics) the classical Oseen- Frank theory may entail paradoxical consequences when applied to describe the equilibrium shapes of droplets surrounded by an isotropic phase: contrary to experimental evidence, they are predicted to dissolve in a plethora of unstable smaller droplets. We proposed a quartic twist theory that prevents such an instability from happening. Here we apply this theory to the data of an experiment devised to measure the planar anchoring strength at the plates bounding a twist cell filled with a chromonic liquid crystal; these data had before been interpreted within the Oseen-Frank theory. We show that the quartic twist theory affords a slightly better agreement with the experimental data, while delivering a larger value for the anchoring strength.",

Specifically, we observe that symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries. For certain three-dimensional theories, this projectivity appears via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels in geometric quantization and the associated integral transforms.",

After recognizing the connection between the capacity and the bilinearly indexed (bli) random processes, we utilize a recent progress in studying such processes to characterize the capacity. In particular, we rely on \\emph{fully lifted} random duality theory (fl RDT) established in \\cite{Stojnicflrdt23} to create a general framework for studying the perceptrons' capacities. Successful underlying numerical evaluations are required for the framework (and ultimately the entire fl RDT machinery) to become fully practically operational. We present results obtained in that directions and uncover that the capacity characterizations are achieved on the second (first non-trivial) level of \\emph{stationarized} full lifting. The obtained results \\emph{exactly} match the replica symmetry breaking predictions obtained through statistical physics replica methods in \\cite{KraMez89}.

        "Abstract": "High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates emerges upon doping the parent Mott insulator. Robust signatures of the low-doped electronic state include a Hall carrier density that initially tracks the number of doped holes and the emergence of an anisotropic pseudogap; the latter characterised by disconnected Fermi arcs, closure at a critical doping level $p^* \\approx 0.19$, and, in some cases, a strongly enhanced carrier effective mass. In Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, a spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulator often regarded as a 5$d$ analogue of the cuprates, surface probes have revealed the emergence of an anisotropic pseudogap and Fermi arcs under electron doping, though neither the corresponding $p^*$ nor bulk signatures of pseudogap closing have as yet been observed. Here, we report electrical transport and specific heat measurements on Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$ over an extended doping range 0 $\\leq x \\leq$ 0.20. The effective carrier density $n_{\\rm H}$ at low temperatures exhibits a crossover from $n_{\\rm H} \\approx x$ to $n_{\\rm H} \\approx 1+x$ near $x$ = 0.16, accompanied by \\textcolor{blue}{a five-orders-of-magnitude increase in conductivity} and a six-fold enhancement in the electronic specific heat. These striking parallels in the bulk pseudogap phenomenology, coupled with the absence of superconductivity in electron-doped Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, disfavour the pseudogap as a state of precursor pairing and thereby narrow the search for the key ingredient underpinning the formation of the superconducting condensate in doped Mott insulators.",

        "Abstract": "The realization of magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) magnets holds great promise for both fundamental research and device applications. Despite recent progress, two-dimensional skyrmion hosts are still limited, due to the fact that most 2D magnets are centrosymmetric and thus lack Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We show here, using a general analysis based on symmetry, that Bloch-type skyrmions can, in fact, be stabilized in 2D magnets, due to the interplay between in-plane component (dx) of second nearest-neighbor DMI and magnetic anisotropy. Its validity is demonstrated in the Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayer, which is also verified by recent experiments. Our work gives a clear direction for experimental studies of 2D magnetic materials to stabilize skyrmions and should greatly enrich the research on magnetic skyrmions in 2D lattices.",

These fascinating many-body phenomena manifest when the low-energy bands feature a narrow band width. In this study, we examine the electronic structure of aAB using first-principles calculations combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We find that the presence of an intrinsic polarization greatly modifies the low-energy bands of aAB. Furthermore, the low-energy bands reach a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle and feature a layer-dependent charge localization and delocalization pattern. In the presence of an electric field, an energy gap opens only if lattice relaxation is taken into account. The particle-hole asymmetry in aAB further leads to flatter conduction bands compared with the valence bands, with an electrically tunable band width and band gap, and a switchable sublattice-dependent charge localization and delocalization pattern.",

        "Abstract": "The deposition and intercalation of metal atoms can induce superconductivity in monolayer and bilayer graphenes. For example, it has been experimentally proved that Li-deposited graphene is a superconductor with critical temperature $T_{c}$ of 5.9 K, Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$ and K-intercalated epitaxial bilayer graphene C$_{8}$KC$_{8}$ are superconductors with $T_{c}$ of 2-4 K and 3.6 K, respectively. However, the $T_{c}$ of them are relatively low. To obtain higher $T_{c}$ in graphene-based superconductors, here we predict a new Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$, which shows higher Ca concentration than the C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$. It is proved to be thermodynamically and dynamically stable. The electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and superconductivity of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ are investigated based on first-principles calculations. The EPC of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ mainly comes from the coupling between the electrons of C-$p_{z}$ orbital and the high- and low-frequency vibration modes of C atoms. The calculated EPC constant $Œª$ of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ is 0.75, and the superconducting $T_{c}$ is 18.9 K, which is much higher than other metal-intercalated bilayer graphenes. By further applying -4\\% biaxial compressive strain to C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$, the $T_{c}$ can be boosted to 26.6 K. Thus, the predicted C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ provides a new platform for realizing superconductivity with the highest $T_{c}$ in bilayer graphenes.",

        "Abstract": "We consider a finite time quantum heat engine analogous to finite time classical Carnot heat engine with a working substance of spin half particles. We study the efficiency at maximum $\\dotŒ©$ figure of merit of the quantum heat engine of spin half particles as a working substance in the presence of external magnetic field. The efficiency of this engine at maximum $\\dotŒ©$ figure of merit shows anomalous behavior in certain region of particles population levels. Further, we find that the efficiency at maximum $\\dotŒ©$ figure exceeds all the known bounds and even approaches the Carnot efficiency at finite time. Our study indicates that the population of spin half particles plays a crucial role in quantum heat engine whose collective effect in the quantum regime can provide superior engine performance with higher efficiency.",

These are semimetals where bands meet generally in 1-dimensional submanifolds, which can generally be knots in $\\T^3$. These nodal loops have two charges, the quantized Berry phase and the $\\Z_2$-monopole charge, the second related to linking numbers of nodal knots between bands.

        "Abstract": "The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, œÑ^{(1)}, œÑ^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and $œÑ^{(1)}$ and $œÑ^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated. The two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling $Œª$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by exchange couplings $1+Œ¥$ and $1-Œ¥$, respectively. Although this model has an infinite number of local conservation laws for $Œ¥=0$, they are lost for finite $Œ¥$. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a nonmagnetic phase and several kinds of ferrimagnetic phases. We find two different ferrimagnetic phases without spontaneous translational symmetry breakdown. It is also found that the quantized ferrimagnetic phases with large spatial periodicities present for $Œ¥=0$ are easily destroyed by small $Œ¥$ and replaced by a partial ferrimagnetic phase. The nonmagnetic phase is considered to be a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase based on the recently extended Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to the site-reflection invariant spin chains and numerical diagonalization results.",

        "Authors": "Xuelei Sui, Xiangru Han, Xiaojun Chen, Liang Qiao, Xiaohong Shao, Bing Huang",
        "Abstract": "The discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 has attracted significant research interest in the field of nickelate superconductors. Despite extensive studies on pristine La3Ni2O7, the impact of oxygen vacancies (VO), a common type of intrinsic defect in oxides, on electronic structures and superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. In this article, we identify the most energetically favorable location for VO formation as the oxygen atom connecting the NiO6 bilayer, resulting in a significant reduction in the lattice constant along the c-axis. Interestingly, the electronic structure undergoes notable changes, particularly for the Ni dz2 and Ni dx2-y2 orbitals. The Ni dz2 orbitals change from partially filled in the pristine La3Ni2O7 to completely filled in the presence of VO, leading to a considerable decrease of its proportion near the Fermi level. Conversely, the proportion of Ni dx2-y2 states increases due to the orbital localization and slight upward shift. Additionally, we observe a significant increase in the hopping of intra-bilayer Ni dz2 orbitals when the VO exists, but with an opposite sign, which differs greatly from the previous understanding. The inter-orbital hopping between Ni dz2 and Ni dx2-y2 orbitals also changes its sign in the presence of VO. Our results indicate that the formation of VO may be harmful to the superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, given the general assumption for the critical role of Ni dz2 in generating superconductivity. Furthermore, we suggest that Ce3Ni2O7, which shares similar electronic structures to La3Ni2O7 but has a larger lattice volume, may be a better candidate for nickelate superconductor due to its lower VO concentration.",

        "Abstract": "We reveal the gate-tunable Berry curvature dipole polarizability in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 nanoplates through measurements of the third-order nonlinear Hall effect. Under an applied electric field, the Berry curvature exhibits an asymmetric distribution, forming a field-induced Berry curvature dipole, resulting in a measurable third-order Hall voltage with a cubic relationship to the longitudinal electric field. Notably, the magnitude and polarity of this third-order nonlinear Hall effect can be effectively modulated by gate voltages. Furthermore, our scaling relation analysis demonstrates that the sign of the Berry curvature dipole polarizability changes when tuning the Fermi level across the Dirac point, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The results highlight the gate control of nonlinear quantum transport in Dirac semimetals, paving the way for promising advancements in topological electronics.",

        "Abstract": "Many material properties can be traced back to properties of their grain boundaries. Grain boundary energy (GBE), as a result, is a key quantity of interest in the analysis and modeling of microstructure. A standard method for calculating grain boundary energy is molecular dynamics (MD); however, on-the-fly MD calculations are not tenable due to the extensive computational time required. Lattice matching (LM) is a reduced-order method for estimating GBE quickly; however, it has only been tested against a relatively limited set of data, and does not have a suitable means for assessing error. In this work, we use the recently published dataset of Homer et al. [1] to assess the performance of LM over the full range of GB space, and to equip LM with a metric for error estimation. LM is used to generate energy estimates, along with predictions of facet morphology, for each of the 7,304 boundaries in the Homer dataset. In keeping with prior work, it is observed that LM predictions of low energy boundaries matches well with MD results. Moreover, there is a good general agreement between LM and MD, and it is apparent that the error scales approximately linearly with the predicted energy value; this makes it possible to establish an empirical estimate on error for future LM calculations. An essential part of the LM method is the faceting relaxation, which corrects the expected energy by convexification across the compact space (S2) of boundary plane orientations. The original Homer dataset did not allow for faceting, but upon extended annealing, it was shown that facet patterns similar to those predicted by LM were emerging.",

These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R√©nyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Bernal-Fowler ice rules govern the phase behaviors of crystalline bulk water by stipulating that each water molecule forms four hydrogen bonds. However, in extreme or constrained conditions, the arrangement of water molecules deviates from conventional ice rules, resulting in properties significantly different from bulk water. In this study, we employ machine learning-driven first-principles simulations to observe a unique violation of the ice rules in a monolayer of water confined within a hydrophobic channel. We observe a quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure in a flat-rhombic phase. This phase consists of strongly hydrogen-bonded linear chains of water molecules that zig-zag along one dimension, stabilized by van der Waals interactions that stack these chains along the other dimension. This arrangement of strong and weak bonds bears similarities with a new class of functional materials called quasi-one-dimensional van der Waals materials. The unusual interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in flat-rhombic ice results in atypical proton disorder, including long-range proton ordering and coherent proton dynamics. Our work sets the stage for discovering new confinement-induced low-dimensional hydrogen-bonded materials and exploiting their electronic, vibronic, and optical properties in ways analogous to quasi-one-dimensional van der Waals materials.",

        "Abstract": "We show through numerical simulation that the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for higher-order, random-coefficient, heavy-hex compatible spin glass Ising models has strong parameter concentration across problem sizes from $16$ up to $127$ qubits for $p=1$ up to $p=5$, which allows for straight-forward transfer learning of QAOA angles on instance sizes where exhaustive grid-search is prohibitive even for $p>1$. We use Matrix Product State (MPS) simulation at different bond dimensions to obtain confidence in these results, and we obtain the optimal solutions to these combinatorial optimization problems using CPLEX. In order to assess the ability of current noisy quantum hardware to exploit such parameter concentration, we execute short-depth QAOA circuits (with a CNOT depth of 6 per $p$, resulting in circuits which contain $1420$ two qubit gates for $127$ qubit $p=5$ QAOA) on $100$ higher-order (cubic term) Ising models on IBM quantum superconducting processors with $16, 27, 127$ qubits using QAOA angles learned from a single $16$-qubit instance. We show that (i) the best quantum processors generally find lower energy solutions up to $p=3$ for 27 qubit systems and up to $p=2$ for 127 qubit systems and are overcome by noise at higher values of $p$, (ii) the best quantum processors find mean energies that are about a factor of two off from the noise-free numerical simulation results. Additional insights from our experiments are that large performance differences exist among different quantum processors even of the same generation and that dynamical decoupling significantly improve performance for some, but decrease performance for other quantum processors. Lastly we show $p=1$ QAOA angle mean energy landscapes computed using up to a $414$ qubit quantum computer, showing that the mean QAOA energy landscapes remain very similar as the problem size changes.",

We introduce a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented, while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach.",

        "Authors": "Vsevolod Ivanov, Lotte Borkowski, Xiangang Wan, Sergey Y. Savrasov",
        "Abstract": "Having previously been the subject of decades of semiconductor research, cadmium arsenide has now reemerged as a topological material, realizing ideal three-dimensional Dirac points at the Fermi level. These topological Dirac points lead to a number of extraordinary transport phenomena, including strong quantum oscillations, large magnetoresistance, ultrahigh mobilities, and Fermi velocities exceeding graphene. The large mobilities persist even in thin films and nanowires of cadmium arsenide, suggesting the involvement of topological surface states. However, computational studies of the surface states in this material are lacking, in part due to the large 80-atom unit cell. Here we present the computed Fermi arc surface states of a cadmium arsenide thin film, based on a tight-binding model derived directly from the electronic structure. We show that despite the close proximity of the Dirac points, the Fermi arcs are very long and straight, extending through nearly the entire Brillouin zone. The shape and spin properties of the Fermi arcs suppress both back- and side- scattering at the surface, which we show by explicit integrals over the phase space. The introduction of a small symmetry-breaking term, expected in a strong electric field, gaps the electronic structure, creating a weak topological insulator phase that exhibits similar transport properties. Crucially, the mechanisms suppressing scattering in this material differ from those in other topological materials such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators, suggesting a new route for engineering high-mobility devices based on Dirac semimetal surface states.",

        "Abstract": "We compute the rotational anisotropy of the free energy of $Œ±$-RuCl$_3$ in an external magnetic field. This quantity, known as the magnetotropic susceptibility, $k$, relates to the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the angle of rotation. We have used approximation-free, auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations for a realistic model of $Œ±$-RuCl$_3$ and optimized the path integral to alleviate the negative sign problem. This allows us to reach temperatures down to $30~\\rm{K}$ -- an energy scale below the dominant Kitaev coupling. We demonstrate that the magnetotropic susceptibility in this model of $Œ±$-RuCl$_3$ displays unique scaling, $k = Tf(B/T)$, with distinct scaling functions $f$ at high and low temperatures. In comparison, for the XXZ Heisenberg model, the scaling $k = Tf(B/T)$ breaks down at a temperature scale where the uniform spin susceptibility deviates from the Curie law (i.e. at the energy scale of the exchange interactions) and never recovers at low temperatures. Our findings suggest that correlations in $Œ±$-RuCl$_3$ lead to degrees of freedom that respond isotropically to a magnetic field. One possible interpretation for the apparent scale-invariance observed in experiments could be fractionalization of the spin degrees of freedom in the extended Kitaev model.",

        "Abstract": "Depletion interactions are thought to significantly contribute to the organization of intracellular structures in the crowded cytosol. The strength of depletion interactions depends on physical parameters like the depletant number density and the depletant size ratio. Cells are known to dynamically regulate these two parameters by varying the copy number of proteins of a wide distribution of sizes. However, mammalian cells are also known to keep the total protein mass density remarkably constant, to within 0.5% throughout the cell cycle. We thus ask how the strength of depletion interactions varies when the total depletant mass is held fixed, a.k.a. fixed-mass depletion. We answer this question via scaling arguments, as well as by studying depletion effects on networks of reconstituted semiflexible actin $\\textit{in silico}$ and $\\textit{in vitro}$. We examine the maximum strength of the depletion interaction potential $U^*$ as a function of $q$, the size ratio between the depletant and the matter being depleted. We uncover a scaling relation $U^* \\sim q^{-Œ∂}$ for two cases: fixed volume fraction $œÜ$ and fixed mass density $œÅ$. For fixed volume fraction, we report $Œ∂< 0$. For the fixed mass density case, we report $Œ∂> 0$, which suggests the depletion interaction strength increases as the depletant size ratio is increased. To test this prediction, we prepared our filament networks at fixed mass concentrations with varying sizes of the depletant molecule poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). We characterize the depletion interaction strength in our simulations via the mesh size. In experiments, we observe two distinct actin network morphologies, which we call weakly bundled and strongly bundled. We identify a mass concentration where different PEG depletant sizes leads to weakly bundled or strongly bundled morphologies...[more in main text].",

        "Authors": "Dietmar Paschek, Johanna Busch, Eduard Mock, Ralf Ludwig, Anne Strate",
        "Abstract": "It is the purpose of this paper to present a computational framework for reliably determining the frequency-dependent intermolecular and intramolecular NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from MD simulations. The approach avoids alterations caused by well-known finite-size effects of the translational diffusion. Moreover, a procedure is derived to control and correct for effects caused by fixed distance-sampling cutoffs and periodic boundary conditions. By construction, this approach is capable of accurately predicting the correct low-frequency scaling behavior of the intermolecular NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate and thus allows the reliable calculation of the frequency-dependent relaxation rate over many orders of magnitude. Our approach is based on the utilisation of the theory of Hwang and Freed for the intermolecular dipole-dipole correlation function and its corresponding spectral density [J. Chem. Phys. 63, 4017 (1975)] and its combination with data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The deviations from the Hwang and Freed theory caused by periodic boundary conditions and sampling distance cutoffs are quantified by means of random walker Monte Carlo simulations. An expression based on the Hwang and Freed theoryis also suggested for correcting those effects. As a proof of principle, our approach is demonstrated by computing the frequency-dependent inter- and intramolecular dipolar NMR relaxation rate of the $^1$H nuclei in liquid water at $273\\,\\mbox{K}$ and $298\\,\\mbox{K}$ based on simulations of the TIP4P/2005 model. Our calculations are suggesting that the intermolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of the TIP4P/2005 model in the extreme narrowing limit has previously been substantially underestimated.",

        "Abstract": "Micromagnetic simulations are used to study a spin-torque vortex oscillator excited by an out-of-plane dc current. The vortex core gyration amplitude is confined between two orbits due to periodical vortex core polarity reversals. The upper limit corresponds to the orbit where the vortex core reaches its critical velocity triggering the first polarity reversal which is immediately followed by a second one. After this double polarity reversal, the vortex core is on a smaller orbit that defines the lower limit of the vortex core gyration amplitude. This double reversal process is a periodic phenomenon and its frequency as well as the upper and lower limits of the vortex core gyration are controlled by the input current density while the vortex chirality determines the onset of this confinement regime. In this non-linear regime, the vortex core never reaches a stable orbit and thus, it may be of interest for neuromorphic application, for example as a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron.",

        "Authors": "Alicia Aguilar-Corona, Micheline Abbas, Matthieu J. Mercier, Laurent Lacaze",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study is to extend the simple concept of apparent coefficient of restitution, widely approached in the literature for the case of a single-contact-point between a sphere and a wall, to the case of bouncing whose complexity is increased due to the shape of the contacting object.\n  Experiments are carried out with a finite-length cylinder, freely falling in a liquid at rest. Complex 3D motions of the cylinder with respect to the wall occur during bouncing, including multi-contact-points between the cylinder and the bottom as well as cavitation.\n  We investigate numerical modelling of an idealized situation (2D infinite cylinder falling parallel to the wall) with 2D simulations where the fluid equations of motion were coupled to the particle equation of motion through an Immersed Boundary Method. The particle equation of motion is coupled to an elastic force to model bouncing, requiring a parameterization of the cut-off length (interpreted as a roughness) and the contact time (associated with the contact elasticity) used here to capture the experimental observations. The simulations confirmed that i) the departure of the coefficient of restitution from 0 is strictly dependent on the apparent roughness and ii) the coefficient of restitution depends on the contact time.\n  Finally, we model the coefficient of restitution as the product of two contributions to the mechanical loss of energy: the collision-to-terminal velocity ratio ($V_c/V_t$) of the approach-phase and the rebound-to-collision velocity ratio ($-V_r/V_c$) of the contact-phase. This leads to a reasonably good prediction of the coefficient of restitution in the intermediate regime in $St$. This suggests the relevance of lumping the complex details of physical phenomena involved during contact into a simple concept based on the contact apparent roughness and elasticity.",

Here we report the first experimental realization of an electrically controlled interlayer trion fluid in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. We demonstrate that in the strong coupling regime of electron-hole bilayers, electrons and holes in separate layers can spontaneously form three-particle trion bound states that resemble positronium ions in high energy physics. The interlayer trions can assume 1e-2h and 2e-1h configurations, where electrons and holes are confined in different transition metal dichalcogenide layers. We show that the two correlated holes in 1e-2h trions form a spin-singlet state with a spin gap of ~1meV. By electrostatic gating, the equilibrium state of our system can be continuously tuned into an exciton fluid, a trion fluid, an exciton-trion mixture, a trion-charge mixture or an electron-hole plasma. Upon optical excitation, the system can host novel high-order multiparticle charge complexes including interlayer four-particle complex (tetrons) and five-particle complex (pentons). Our work demonstrates a unique platform to study novel correlated phases of tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures and opens up new opportunities to realize artificial ions/molecules in electronic devices.",

        "Authors": "Alexander Friedland, Payel Mukhopadhyay, Amol V. Patwardhan",
        "Abstract": "The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $ŒΩp$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $ŒΩp$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb. Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\\lesssim105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$Œ±$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the {$\\gtrsim1.7 M_\\odot$ range}. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.",

        "Abstract": "Polarisation is a powerful remote-sensing tool to study the nature of particles scattering the starlight. It is widely used to characterise interplanetary dust particles in the Solar System and increasingly employed to investigate extrasolar dust in debris discs' systems. We aim to measure the scattering properties of the dust from the debris ring around HD 181327 at near-infrared wavelengths. We obtained high-contrast polarimetric images of HD 181327 in the H band with the SPHERE / IRDIS instrument on the Very Large Telescope (ESO). We complemented them with archival data from HST / NICMOS in the F110W filter reprocessed in the context of the Archival Legacy Investigations of Circumstellar Environments (ALICE) project. We developed a combined forward-modelling framework to simultaneously retrieve the scattering phase function in polarisation and intensity. We detected the debris disc around HD 181327 in polarised light and total intensity. We measured the scattering phase function and the degree of linear polarisation of the dust at 1.6 micron in the birth ring. The maximum polarisation is 23.6% +/- 2.6% and occurs between a scattering angle of 70 deg and 82 deg. We show that compact spherical particles made of a highly refractive and relatively absorbing material in a differential power-law size distribution of exponent $-3.5$ can simultaneously reproduce the polarimetric and total intensity scattering properties of the dust. This type of material cannot be obtained with a mixture of silicates, amorphous carbon, water ice, and porosity, and requires a more refracting component such as iron-bearing minerals. We reveal a striking analogy between the near-infrared polarisation of comets and that of HD 181327. The methodology developed here combining VLT/SPHERE and HST/NICMOS may be applicable in the future to combine the polarimetric capabilities of SPHERE with the sensitivity of JWST.",

        "Abstract": "T Pyx is one of the most enigmatic recurrent novae, and it has been proposed as a potential Galactic type-Ia supernova progenitor. Using spatially-resolved data obtained with MUSE, we characterized the geometrical distribution of the material expelled in previous outbursts surrounding the white dwarf progenitor. We used a 3D model for the ejecta to determine the geometric distribution of the extended remnant. We have also calculated the nebular parallax distance ($d = 3.55 \\pm 0.77$ kpc) based on the measured velocity and spatial shift of the 2011 bipolar ejecta. These findings confirm previous results, including data from the GAIA mission. The remnant of T Pyx can be described by a two-component model, consisting of a tilted ring at $i = 63.7$ deg, relative to its normal vector and by fast bipolar ejecta perpendicular to the plane of the equatorial ring. We find an upper limit for the bipolar outflow ejected mass in 2011 of the bipolar outflow of $M_{ej,b} < (3.0 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$, which is lower than previous estimates given in the literature. However, only a detailed physical study of the equatorial component could provide an accurate estimate of the total ejecta of the last outburst, a fundamental step to understand if T Pyx will end its life as a type-Ia supernova.",

In astronomical applications, PLs can efficiently couple multi-mode telescope light into a multi-mode fiber entrance and convert it into multiple single-mode beams. The output beams are highly stable and suitable for feeding into high-resolution spectrographs or photonic chip beam combiners. For instance, by using relative intensities in the output cores as a function of wavelength, PLs can enable spectroastrometry. In addition, by interfering beams in the output cores with a beam combiner in the backend, PLs can be used for high-throughput interferometric imaging. When used on an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), with its increased sensitivity and angular resolution, the imaging and spectroastrometric capabilities of PLs will be extended to higher contrast and smaller angular scales. We study the potential spectroastrometry and imaging science cases of PLs on ELTs, including study of exomoons, broad-line regions of quasars, and inner circumstellar disks.",

        "Authors": "O. V. Agapitov, J. F. Drake, M. Swisdak, K. -E. Choi, N. Raouafi",
        "Abstract": "Switchbacks (SBs) are localized structures in the solar wind containing deflections of the magnetic field direction relative to the background solar wind magnetic field. The amplitudes of the magnetic field deflection angles for different SBs vary from ~40 to ~160-170 degrees. Alignment of the perturbations of the magnetic field and the bulk solar wind velocity is observed inside SBs and causes spiky enhancements of the radial bulk velocity inside SBs. We have investigated the deviations of SB perturbations from Alfv√©nicity by evaluating the distribution of the parameter defined as the ratio of the parallel to $Œî\\vec{B}$ component of $Œî\\vec{V}$ to $Œî\\vec{V}_A = Œî\\vec{B}/4œÄn_i m_i$ inside SBs, i.e. $Œ±=V_{||}/|Œî\\vec{V}_A|$ ( $Œ±=Œî\\vec{V}/|Œî\\vec{V}_A|$ when $Œî\\vec{V}~Œî\\vec{B}$), which quantifies the deviation of the perturbation from an Alfv√©nic one. Based on Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations, we show that $Œ±$ inside SBs has systematically lower values than it has in the pristine solar wind: $Œ±$ inside SBs observed during PSP Encounter 1 were distributed in a range of 0.2-0.9. The upper limit on $Œ±$ is constrained by the requirement that the jump in velocity across the switchback boundary be less than the local Alfv√©n speed. This prevents the onset of shear flow instabilities. The consequence is that the perturbation of the proton bulk velocity in SBs with deflection greater than 60 degrees cannot reach $Œ±=1$ (the Alfv√©nicity condition) and the highest possible $Œ±$ for a SB with the full reversal of B is 0.5. These results have consequences for the interpretation of switchbacks as large amplitude Alfv√©n waves.",

        "Abstract": "The Aether-Scalar-Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR) which can support Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) behaviour in its static weak-field limit, and cosmological evolution resembling $Œõ$CDM. We consider static spherically symmetric weak-field solutions in this theory and show that the resulting equations can be reduced to a single equation for the gravitational potential. The reduced equation has apparent isolated singularities when the derivative of the potential passes through zero and we show how these are removed by evolving, instead, the canonical momentum of the corresponding Hamiltonian system that we find. We construct solutions in three cases: (i) vacuum outside a bounded spherical object, (ii) within an extended prescribed source, and (iii) isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium, serving as a simplified model for galaxy clusters. We show that the oscillatory regime that follows the Newtonian and MOND regimes, obtained in previous works in the vacuum case, also persists for isothermal spheres, and we show that the gas density profiles in AeST may become more compressed than their Newtonian or MOND counterparts. We construct the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) in AeST for isothermal spheres and find that it can display a peak, an enhancement with respect to the MOND RAR, at an acceleration range determined by the value of the AeST weak-field mass parameter, the mass of the system and the boundary value of the gravitational potential. For lower accelerations, the AeST RAR drops below the MOND expectation, as if there is a negative mass density. Similar observational features of the galaxy cluster RAR have been reported. This illustrates the potential of AeST to address the shortcomings of MOND in galaxy clusters, but a full quantitative comparison with observations will require going beyond the isothermal case.",

We compute the velocity-integrated Stokes $I$ and $V$, as well as the implied $V/I$ polarization percentage, for each detector pixel location in our simulated emission maps. Our results show that both types of protostellar environment are in principle accessible with current circular polarization instruments, with each containing swaths of envelope area that yield percentage polarizations that exceed the 1.8\\% nominal sensitivity limit for circular polarization experiments with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). In both systems, high polarization ($\\gtrsim$1.8\\%) pixels tend to lie at an intermediate distance away from the central star and where the line-center opacity of the CN emission is moderately optically thin ($œÑ_{LC} \\sim 0.1-1$). Furthermore, our computed $V/I$ values scale roughly with the density weighted mean line-of-sight magnetic field strength, indicating that Zeeman observations can effectively diagnose the strength of envelope-scale magnetic fields. We also find that pixels with large $V/I$ are preferentially co-located where the absolute value of the velocity-integrated $V$ is also large, suggesting that locations with favorable percentage polarization are also favorable in terms of raw signal.",

        "Abstract": "As experiment charts new territory at the electroweak scale, the enterprise to characterise all possible theories becomes all the more necessary. In the absence of new particles, this ambitious enterprise is attainable and has led to the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) as the most general characterising framework, containing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a subspace. The characterisation of this theory space led to the dichotomy SMEFT vs. HEFT\\SMEFT as the two possible realisations of symmetry breaking. The criterion to distinguish these two possibilities is non-local in field space, and phenomena which explore field space beyond the neighbourhood of the vacuum manifold are in a singular position to tell them apart. Cosmology allows for such phenomena, and this work focuses on HEFT\\SMEFT, the less explored of the two options, to find that first order phase transitions with detectable gravitational wave remnants, domain wall formation and vacuum decay in the far, far distant future can take place and single out HEFT\\SMEFT. Results in cosmology are put against LHC constraints, and the potential of future ground- and space-based experiments to cover parameter space is discussed.",

        "Authors": "Mark W. Phillips, Michael C. Liu, Zhoujian Zhang",
        "Abstract": "Measurements of the C/O ratio in brown dwarfs are lacking, in part due to past models adopting solar C/O only. We have expanded the ATMO 2020 atmosphere model grid to include non-solar metallicities and C/O ratios in the T dwarf regime. We change the C/O ratio by altering either the carbon or oxygen elemental abundances, and we find that non-solar abundances of these elements can be distinguished based on the shapes of the $H$- and $K$- bands. We compare these new models with medium-resolution ($R\\approx1700$), near-infrared ($0.8-2.4\\,Œº$m) Gemini/GNIRS spectra of three benchmark late-T dwarfs, GJ 570D, HD 3651B, and Ross 458C. We find solar C/O ratios and best-fitting parameters ($T_\\mathrm{eff}$, $\\log(g)$, $Z$) broadly consistent with other analyses in the literature based on low-resolution ($R\\sim100$) data. The model-data discrepancies in the near-infrared spectra are consistent across all three objects. These discrepancies are alleviated when fitting the Y, J, H and K bands individually, but the resulting best-fit parameters are inconsistent and disagree with the results from the full-spectrum. By examining the model atmosphere properties we find this is due to the interplay of gravity and metallicity on $\\mathrm{H_2-H_2}$ collisionally induced absorption. We therefore conclude that there are no significant issues with the molecular opacity tables used in the models at this spectral resolution. Instead, deficiencies are more likely to lie in the model assumptions regarding the thermal structures. Finally, we find a discrepancy between the GNIRS, SpeX, and other near-infrared spectra in the literature of Ross 458C, indicating potential spectroscopic variability.",

        "Abstract": "Future observations with next-generation large-area radio telescopes are expected to discover radio pulsars (PSRs) closely orbiting around Sagittarius~A* (Sgr~A*), the supermassive black hole (SMBH) dwelling at our Galactic Center (GC). Such a system can provide a unique laboratory for testing General Relativity (GR), as well as the astrophysics around the GC. In this paper, we provide a numerical timing model for PSR-SMBH systems based on the post-Newtonian (PN) equation of motion, and use it to explore the prospects of measuring the black hole (BH) properties with pulsar timing. We further consider the perturbation caused by the dark matter (DM) distribution around Sgr~A*, and the possibility of constraining DM models with PSR-SMBH systems. Assuming a 5-year observation of a normal pulsar in an eccentric ($e=0.8$) orbit with an orbital period $P_b = 0.5\\,$yr, we find that -- with weekly recorded times of arrival (TOAs) and a timing precision of 1 ms -- the power-law index of DM density distribution near the GC can be constrained to about 20%. Such a measurement is comparable to those measurements at the Galactic length scale but can reveal small-scale properties of the DM.",

        "Authors": "Adrien Houge, Enrique Mac√≠as, Sebastiaan Krijt",
        "Abstract": "Investigating the response of icy dust aggregates to water ice sublimation is essential for understanding the formation and properties of planetesimals in protoplanetary discs. However, their fate remains unclear, as previous studies suggest aggregates could either survive or completely fall apart to (sub)Œºm-sized grains. Protoplanetary discs around stars undergoing accretion outbursts represent a unique laboratory to study the ice sublimation process, as the water snowline is pushed outward to regions accessible to current observatories. In this work, we aim to understand the aggregates' response to ice sublimation by focusing on V883 Ori, a system currently undergoing a powerful accretion outburst. We present new analysis of archival high resolution ALMA observations of the protoplanetary disc of V883 Ori at 0.88, 1.3, 2.0, and 3.1 mm, and derive new radial spectral index profiles, which we compare with predictions from one-dimensional dust evolution simulations. In the region of V883 Ori where water ice has sublimated, we find lower spectral indices than previously obtained, indicating the presence of cm-sized particles. Coupled with our dust evolution models, we find that the only way to explain their presence is to assume they formed before the outburst, and survived the sublimation process. The resilience of dust aggregates to such intense events leads us to speculate that it may extend to other environments with more gentle heating, such as pebbles drifting through the water snowline in quiescent protoplanetary discs. In that case, it may alter the formation pathway of dry planetesimals interior to the snowline.",

        "Authors": "Clare Dobbs",
        "Abstract": "Simulations from the scales of isolated galaxies to clouds have been instrumental in informing us about molecular cloud formation and evolution. Simulations are able to investigate the roles of gravity, feedback, turbulence, heating and cooling, and magnetic fields on the physics of the interstellar medium, and star formation. Compared to simulations of individual clouds, galactic and sub-galactic scale simulations can include larger galactic scale processes such as spiral arms, bars, and larger supernovae bubbles, which may influence star formation. Simulations show cloud properties and lifetimes in broad agreement with observations. Gravity and spiral arms are required to produce more massive GMCs, whilst stellar feedback, likely photoionisation, leads to relatively short cloud lifetimes. On larger scales, supernovae may be more dominant in driving the structure and dynamics, but photoionisation may still have a role. In terms of the dynamics, feedback is probably the main driver of velocity dispersions, but large scale processes such as gravity and spiral arms may also be significant. Magnetic fields are generally found to decrease star formation on galaxy or cloud scales, and simulations are ongoing to study whether clouds are sub or supercritical on different scales in galaxy scale simulations. Simulations on subgalactic scales, or zoom in simulations, allow better resolution of feedback processes, filamentary structure within clouds, and the study of stellar clusters.",

Among them, GSN 069 is the only one with a tidal disruption event(TDE), which was recently found to have brightened again 9 years after the main outburst.However, the origin of this TDE is still unclear. By comparing the fallback time with observation, we found it can not be the disruption of the envelope of a single star in the tidal stripping model. Thus, we suggest that it is a disruption of a common envelope(CE).By calculating the fallback rate of such a model, we reproduce the second peak in the observational TDE. If this model is true, this TDE will be the closest one to a direct observation of CE.",

The search was carried out using continuous Konus-Wind data with 2.944 s time resolution. We perform a targeted search for each individual burst from 581 FRBs, along with a stacking analysis of the bursts from 8 repeating sources in our sample and a separate stacking analysis of the bursts from the non-repeating FRBs. We find no significant associations in either case. We report upper bounds on the hard X-ray (20 - 1500 keV) flux assuming four spectral models, which generally describe spectra of short and long GRBs, magnetar giant flares, and the short burst, coincident with FRB 200428 from a Galactic magnetar.

For 18 FRBs with known distances we present upper bounds on the isotropic equivalent energy release and peak luminosity. For the nearest FRB 200120E, we derive the most stringent upper bounds of $E_{\\text{iso}}\\leq$2.0 $\\times 10^{44}$ erg and $L_{\\text{iso}}\\leq$1.2 $\\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

        "Authors": "Robin Joshi, Lawrence M. Widrow",
        "Abstract": "We investigate the effects of halo kinematics on the dynamics of stellar discs by simulating the evolution of isolated disc-halo systems from equilibrium initial conditions. Our main results come from four simulations where the initial disc is identical and the halo is either treated as a rigid potential or is live with isotropic orbits or orbits that preferentially rotate with or counter to the disc. We confirm previous results that bar formation is more vigorous in models with a live halo than a rigid one and is further enhanced when halo orbits preferentially rotate with the disc. We discuss two types of buckling events with different symmetries about the mid plane, one that occurs just as the bar is forming and the other well after the bar has been established. We also show that warps are most easily excited and maintained when the halo is counter-rotating with the disc, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our most novel result is the discovery of a rotating halo instability, which causes the disc and halo cusp to spiral outward from the centre of mass of the system whether the halo rotates with the disc or counter to it and also occurs in a disc bulge halo system that does not form a bar. We provide a heuristic linear model that captures the essential dynamics of the instability.",

        "Authors": "Elena Fedorova, Lidiia Zadorozhna, Anatolii Tugay, Nadiia Pulatova, Alexander Ganz, Olexandr Gugnin",
        "Abstract": "We develop the recipe to separate the spectral counterparts of the AGN NGC 1275 from the emission of the Perseus cluster surrounding it in the spectra observed by Suzaku/XIS cameras with no usage of the spectral fitting models. The Perseus cluster emission reaches higher energies than is typical for the most AGN-situated dense surroundings (i.e. up to 9-10 keV). That is why the separation between the AGN and cluster spectra is especially important in this case. To avoid the degeneracy due to the huge quantity of the spectral fitting parameters such as abundances of elements the cluster consists of, thermal and Compton emission of the nucleus itself, and the jet SSC/IC emission spectral parameters as well we prefer to avoid the spectral fitting usage to perform this task. Instead, we use the spatial resolution of the components and double background subtracting. For this purpose we choose the following regions to collect all the photons from them: (1) circular or square-shaped region around the source (AGN); (2) ring-shaped (or non-overlapped square) region surrounding the AGN (for cluster); (3) remote empty circular region for the background. Having collected the photons from those regions we subtract the background (i.e. photons from the third region) from the source and cluster spectra. Next, we subtract the re-normalized cluster counts from the AGN spectrum; using the relation between the emission line amplitudes in the AGN and cluster spectra as the renormalization coefficient. We have performed this procedure on the whole set of the Suzaku/XIS observational data for NGC 1275 to obtain the cleaned spectra and light curve of the AGN emission in this system.",

        "Abstract": "The enormous increase in mid-IR sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution provided by the JWST spectrographs enables, for the first time, detailed extragalactic studies of molecular vibrational bands. This opens an entirely new window for the study of the molecular interstellar medium in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). We present a detailed analysis of rovibrational bands of gas-phase CO, H$_2$O, C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN towards the heavily-obscured eastern nucleus of the LIRG VV 114, as observed by NIRSpec and MIRI MRS. Spectra extracted from apertures of 130 pc in radius show a clear dichotomy between the obscured AGN and two intense starburst regions. We detect the 2.3 $Œº$m CO bandheads, characteristic of cool stellar atmospheres, in the star-forming regions, but not towards the AGN. Surprisingly, at 4.7 $\\mathrmŒº$m we find highly-excited CO ($T_\\mathrm{ex} \\approx 700$ K; 1000 K out to at least rotational level $J = 27$) towards the star-forming regions, but only cooler gas ($T_\\mathrm{ex} \\approx 170$ K) towards the AGN. We conclude that only mid-infrared pumping through the rovibrational lines can account for the equilibrium conditions found for CO and H$_2$O in the deeply-embedded starbursts. Here the CO bands probe regions with an intense local radiation field inside dusty young massive star clusters or near the most massive young stars. The lack of high-excitation molecular gas towards the AGN is attributed to geometric dilution of the intense radiation from the bright point source. An overview of the relevant excitation and radiative transfer physics is provided in an appendix.",

        "Abstract": "The satellite Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO), due to be launched late 2026, will provide us with an unprecedented sample of light curves of solar-type stars that will exhibit both solar-type oscillations and signatures of activity-induced brightness modulations. Solar-type pulsators only have moderate levels of activity because high levels of activity inhibit oscillations. This means that these targets represent a specific challenge for starspot modelling. In order to assess the possibilities that PLATO will soon open, we wish to characterise the morphology of active regions at the surface of stars for which we also have a detection of solar-like acoustic oscillations. In this context, we report the results of an ensemble starspot modelling analysis of the Sun and ten solar-type pulsators observed by the Kepler satellite. We implement a Bayesian starspot modelling approach based on a continuous-grid model, accounting for the combined starspot and facular contribution to activity-induced brightness modulations. From our analysis, we find that several stars of our sample exhibit clear signatures of stable longitudinal active nests while sharing activity levels and convection versus rotation regimes similar to the solar regime. By searching for modulations in the reconstructed starspot coverage, we found significant periodicities that we identify as possible signatures of cyclic modulations similar to the quasi-biennal oscillation or the Rieger cycle. We can infer the corresponding intensity of the magnetic field at the bottom of the convective envelope based on the hypothesis that internal magneto-Rossby waves acting on the tachocline cause these modulations.",

        "Authors": "Matt G. Lodge, Hannah R. Wakeford, Zoe M. Leinhardt",
        "Abstract": "The optical properties of particulate-matter aerosols, within the context of exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, are compared using three different models: Mie theory, Modified Mean Field (MMF) Theory, and Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Previous results have demonstrated that fractal haze particles (MMF and DDA) absorb much less long-wavelength radiation than their spherical counterparts (Mie), however it is shown here that the opposite can also be true if a more varying refractive index profile is used. Additionally, it is demonstrated that absorption and scattering cross-sections, as well as the asymmetry parameter, are underestimated if Mie theory is used. Although DDA can be used to obtain more accurate results, it is known to be much more computationally intensive; to avoid this, the use of low-resolution aerosol models is explored, which could dramatically speed up the process of obtaining accurate computations of optical cross-sections within a certain parameter space. The validity of DDA is probed for wavelengths of interest for observations of aerosols within exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres (0.2 to 15 micrometres). Finally, novel code is presented to compare the results of Mie, MMF and DDA theories (CORAL: Comparison Of Radiative AnaLyses), as well as to increase and decrease the resolution of DDA shape files accordingly (SPHERIFY). Both codes can be applied to a range of other interesting astrophysical environments in addition to exoplanet atmospheres, for example dust grains within protoplanetary disks.",

        "Abstract": "High-precision pulsar timing observations are limited in their accuracy by the jitter noise that appears in the arrival time of pulses. Therefore, it is important to systematically characterise the amplitude of the jitter noise and its variation with frequency. In this paper, we provide jitter measurements from low-frequency wideband observations of PSR J0437$-$4715 using data obtained as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. We were able to detect jitter in both the 300 - 500 MHz and 1260 - 1460 MHz observations of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The former is the first jitter measurement for this pulsar below 700 MHz, and the latter is in good agreement with results from previous studies. In addition, at 300 - 500 MHz, we investigated the frequency dependence of the jitter by calculating the jitter for each sub-banded arrival time of pulses. We found that the jitter amplitude increases with frequency. This trend is opposite as compared to previous studies, indicating that there is a turnover at intermediate frequencies. It will be possible to investigate this in more detail with uGMRT observations at 550 - 750 MHz and future high sensitive wideband observations from next generation telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array. We also explored the effect of jitter on the high precision dispersion measure (DM) measurements derived from short duration observations. We find that even though the DM precision will be better at lower frequencies due to the smaller amplitude of jitter noise, it will limit the DM precision for high signal-to-noise observations, which are of short durations. This limitation can be overcome by integrating for a long enough duration optimised for a given pulsar.",

        "Abstract": "We present the analysis of 200-ks NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The phase-resolved spectra corresponding to the two main peaks in the folded pulse profile differ significantly. The spectrum of Peak 1 is significantly harder than that of Peak 2 in qualitative agreement with the earlier RXTE results. However, for both spectra, the best-fit values of photon indices for the power-law (PL) fit are noticeably larger than the previously reported values. The hardest (Peak 1) spectrum has a photon index of $1.10\\pm0.15$ which is close to those measured for the bright inner jets of the PWN. We used the off-pulse interval to isolate pulsar emission and measure the compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN) spectrum in hard X-rays. We also measured the spectrum from the south-western (SW) region of the PWN which is resolved by NuSTAR from the compact PWN. For both regions, we fit the NuSTAR spectra by themselves and together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory spectra. We found that the compact PWN spectrum requires a more complex model than a simple PL with evidence for exponential cutoff in 50-80 keV. We do not find such evidence for the spectrum extracted from the SW PWN region, located farther from the pulsar, implying the energies over 600 TeV for the pulsar wind particles. This may indicate in-situ particle acceleration in that region.",

        "Abstract": "Dusty star-forming galaxies emit most of their light at far-IR to mm wavelengths as their star formation is highly obscured. Far-IR and mm observations have revealed their dust, neutral and molecular gas properties. The sensitivity of JWST at rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths now allows the study of the stellar and ionized gas content. We investigate the spatially resolved distribution and kinematics of the ionized gas in GN20, a dusty star forming galaxy at $z$=4.0548. We present deep MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy of the near-infrared rest-frame emission of GN20. We detect spatially resolved \\paa, out to a radius of 6 kpc, distributed in a clumpy morphology. The star formation rate derived from \\paa\\ (144 $\\pm$ 9 \\msunperyear) is only 7.7 $\\pm 0.5 $\\% of the infrared star formation rate (1860 $\\pm$ 90 \\msunperyear). We attribute this to very high extinction (A$_V$ = 17.2 $\\pm$ 0.4 mag, or A$_{V,mixed}$ = 44 $\\pm$ 3 mag), especially in the nucleus of GN20, where only faint \\paa\\ is detected, suggesting a deeply buried starburst. We identify four, spatially unresolved, clumps in the \\paa\\ emission. Based on the double peaked \\paa\\ profile we find that each clump consist of at least two sub-clumps. We find mass upper limits consistent with them being formed in a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk. The UV bright region of GN20 does not have any detected \\paa\\ emission, suggesting an age of more than 10 Myrs for this region of the galaxy. From the rotation profile of \\paa\\ we conclude that the gas kinematics are rotationally dominated and the $v_{rot}/œÉ_{m} = 3.8 \\pm 1.4$ is similar to low-redshift LIRGs. We speculate that the clumps seen in GN20 could contribute to building up the inner disk and bulge of GN20.",

        "Authors": "Yu Zhou, Noriko Y. Yamasaki, Shin Toriumi, Kazuhisa Mitsuda",
        "Abstract": "We report the discovery of a geocoronal solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) event corresponding to the well-known 2006 December 13th coronal mass ejection (CME) event. Strong evidence for the charge exchange origin of this transient diffuse emission is provided by prominent non-thermal emission lines at energies of $\\rm O^{7+}$, $\\rm Ne^{9+}$, $\\rm Mg^{11+}$, $\\rm Si^{12+}$, $\\rm Si^{13+}$. Especially, a 0.53 keV emission line that most likely arises from the $\\rm N^{5+}$ $1s^1 5p^1 \\to 1s^2$ transition is detected. Previously, the forecastability of SWCX occurrence with proton flares has been disputed. In this particular event, we found that the SWCX signal coincided with the arrival of the magnetic cloud inside CME, triggered with a time delay after the proton flux fluctuation as the CME shock front passed through the Earth. Moreover, a spacecraft orbital modulation in SWCX light curve suggests that the emission arises close to the Earth. The line of sight was found to always pass through the northern magnetospheric cusp. The SWCX intensity was high when the line of sight passed the dusk side of the cusp, suggesting an azimuthal anisotropy in the flow of solar-wind ions inside the cusp. An axisymmetric SWCX emission model is found to underestimate the observed peak intensity by a factor of about 50. We suggest this discrepancy is related to the azimuthal anisotropy of the solar-wind flow in the cusp.",

        "Abstract": "Alignments of disc galaxies were thought to result from tidal torquing, where tidal field of the cosmic large-scale structure exert torquing moments onto dark matter haloes, determining their angular momentum and ultimately the orientation of galactic discs. In this model, resulting intrinsic ellipticity correlations are typically present on small scales, but neither observations nor simulations have found empirical evidence; instead, simulations point at the possibility that alignments of disc galaxies follow a similar alignment model as elliptical galaxies, but with a weaker alignment amplitude. In our article we make the case for the theory of linear alignments resulting from tidal distortions of the galactic disc, investigate the physical properties of this model and derive the resulting angular ellipticity spectra, as they would appear as a contribution to weak gravitational lensing in surveys such as Euclid's. We discuss in detail on the statistical and physical properties of tidally induced alignments in disc galaxies, as they are relevant for mitigation of alignment contamination in weak lensing data, comment on the consistency between the alignment amplitude in spiral and elliptical galaxies and finally, estimate their observability with a Euclid-like survey.",

        "Abstract": "We study the size-mass relation (SMR) and recent star formation history (SFH) of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in the local Universe, using spatially resolved spectroscopy from the final data release of MaNGA. Our sample includes 489 PSB galaxies: 94 cPSB galaxies with central PSB regions, 85 rPSB galaxies with ring-like PSB regions and 310 iPSB galaxies with irregular PSB regions. When compared to control galaxies of similar SFR, redshift and mass, a similar SMR is found for all types of PSB samples except the cPSB galaxies which have smaller sizes at intermediate masses ($9.5\\lesssim \\log_{10}(\\rm M_\\ast/M_\\odot)\\lesssim 10.5$). The iPSB galaxies in the star-forming sequence (iPSB-SF) show no/weak gradients in $\\textrm{D}_{n}(4000)$, $\\textrm{EW}(\\textrm{H}Œ¥_{A})$ and $\\textrm{EW}(\\textrm{H}Œ±)$, consistent with the global star-forming status of this type of galaxies, while the quiescent iPSB (iPSB-Q) sample shows negative gradients in $\\textrm{D}_{n}(4000)$ and positive gradients in $\\textrm{EW}(\\textrm{H}Œ¥_{A})$, indicating older stellar populations in the inner regions. Both cPSB and rPSB samples show positive gradients in $\\textrm{D}_{n}(4000)$ and negative gradients in $\\textrm{EW}(\\textrm{H}Œ¥_{A})$, indicating younger stellar populations in the inner regions. These results imply that the four types of PSB galaxies can be broadly divided into two distinct categories in terms of evolutionary pathway: (1) iPSB-SF and iPSB-Q which have SMRs and SFHs similar to control galaxies, preferring an inside-out quenching process, (2) rPSB and cPSB which appear to be different stages of the same event, likely to follow the outside-in quenching process driven by disruption events such as mergers that result in a more compact structure as quenching proceeds.",

        "Abstract": "We examine various exact solutions in \"Cotton Gravity\" (CG), a new gravity theory that provides an extension of General Relativity (GR) based on the Cotton tensor. Using an alternative formulation of the field equations in terms of a Codazzi tensor, we obtain various non-trivial CG exact solutions that generalize known GR solutions: FLRW cosmologies, Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) and Szekeres dust solutions, as well as static perfect fluid spheres and solutions with a shear-free 4 velocity. We show that CG modifies the spatial curvature of the nonstatic GR solutions. Demanding a well posed initial value formulation keeps the same dynamics of FLRW models of GR, but with the cosmological constant interpreted as constant spatial curvature. In other solutions the modification of spatial curvature allows for self-consistent significant changes in the dynamics, an time and spece dependent evolution from decelerated to accelerated expansion driven by negative spatial curvature and without necessarily assuming a dark energy source or imposing a cosmological constant. The $Œõ$CDM model naturally emerges as the unique FLRW dust model of CG with constant negative spatial curvature. Static fluid spheres in the weak field regime of CG allow for modeling the flattening of rotation velocities in galactic systems without assuming dark matter. The methods we have presented can be improved to be able to obtain more general solutions that will facilitate the application of CG to current open problems in gravitational systems in general.",

        "Authors": "Philipp Euringer, Niklas Houba, Gerald Hechenblaikner, Oliver Mandel, Francis Soualle, Walter Fichter",
        "Abstract": "In the context of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the laser subsystems exhibit frequency fluctuations that introduce significant levels of noise into the measurements, surpassing the gravitational wave signal by several orders of magnitude. Mitigation is achieved via time-shifting individual measurements in a data processing step known as time-delay interferometry (TDI). The suppression performance of TDI relies on accurate knowledge and consideration of the delays experienced by the interfering lasers. While considerable efforts have been dedicated to the accurate determination of inter-spacecraft ranging delays, the sources for onboard delays have been either neglected or assumed to be known. Contrary to these assumptions, analog delays of the phasemeter front end and the laser modulator are not only large but also prone to change with temperature and heterodyne frequency. This motivates our proposal for a novel method enabling a calibration of these delays on-ground and in-space, based on minimal functional additions to the receiver architecture. Specifically, we establish a set of calibration measurements and elucidate how these measurements are utilized in data processing, leading to the mitigation of the delays in the TDI Michelson variables. Following a performance analysis of the calibration measurements, proposed calibration scheme is assessed through numerical simulations. We find that in the absence of the calibration scheme, the assumed drifts of the analog delays increase residual laser noise at high frequencies of the LISA measurement band. A single, on-ground calibration of the analog delays leads to an improvement by roughly one order of magnitude, while re-calibration in space may improve performance by yet another order of magnitude. Towards lower frequencies, ranging error is always found to be the limiting factor for which countermeasures are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "We examine the contribution of tensor modes, in addition to the dominant scalar ones, on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To this end, we analyze in detail the temperature two-point angular correlation function $C(Œ∏)$ from the Planck 2018 dataset, focusing on large angles ($Œ∏\\gtrsim 120^{\\circ}$) corresponding to small $\\ell$ multipoles. A hierarchical set of infrared cutoffs are naturally introduced to the scalar and tensor power spectra of the CMB by invoking an extra Kaluza-Klein dimension compactifying at about the GUT scale between the Planck epoch and the start of inflation. We associate this set of lower scalar and tensor cutoffs with the parity of the multipole expansion of the $C(Œ∏)$ function. By fitting the Planck 2018 data we compute the multipole coefficients thereby reproducing the well-known odd-parity preference in angular correlations seen by all three satellite missions COBE, WMAP and Planck. Our fits improve significantly once tensor modes are included in the analysis, hence providing a hint of the imprints of primordial gravitational waves on the temperature correlations observed in the CMB today. To conclude we suggest a relationship between, on the one hand, the lack of (positive) large-angle correlations and the odd-parity dominance in the CMB and, on the other hand, the effect of primordial gravitational waves on the CMB temperature anisotropies.",

Since the Leo I group lies at just a 10 Mpc distance, it is at the ideal location to compare results from resolved stellar populations with the homogeneous constraints over a much larger field of view from the PN populations. In M105, we have -- for the first time -- established a direct link between the presence of a metal-poor halo as traced by resolved red-giant branch stars and a PN population with a high specific frequency ($Œ±$-parameter). This confirms our inferences that the high $Œ±$-parameter PN population in the outer halo of M49 in the Virgo Cluster traces the metal-poor halo and intra-group light.",

We calculate the leading effective Lagrangian for a compact binary and obtain the periastron advance per period. In particular, we apply our analytical calculation to two binary systems, PSR B 1534+12 and PSR J0737-3039, and constrain the relevant model parameters. The theoretical framework can also be extended to higher order systematically.",

        "Abstract": "WL 17 is a Class I object and was considered to have a ring-hole structure. We analyzed the structure around WL 17 to investigate the detailed properties of WL 17. We used ALMA archival data, which have a higher angular resolution than previous observations. We investigated the WL 17 system with the 1.3 mm dust continuum and 12CO and C18O (J = 2-1) line emissions. The dust continuum emission showed a clear ring structure with inner and outer edges of ~11 and ~21 au, respectively. In addition, we detected an inner disk of < 5 au radius enclosing the central star within the ring, the first observation of this structure. Thus, WL 17 has a ring-gap structure, not a ring-hole structure. We did not detect any marked emission in either the gap or inner disk, indicating that there is no sign of a planet, circumplanetary disk, or binary companion. We identified the base of both blue-shifted and red-shifted outflows based on the 12CO emission, which is clearly associated with the disk around WL 17. The outflow mass ejection rate is ~3.6x10^-7 Msun yr-1 and the dynamical timescale is as short as ~ 10^4 yr. The C18O emission showed that an inhomogeneous infalling envelope, which can induce episodic mass accretion, is distributed in the region within ~1000 au from the central protostar. With these new findings, we can constrain the planet formation and dust growth scenarios in the accretion phase of star formation.",

        "Abstract": "Studying the escaping atmospheres of highly-irradiated exoplanets is critical for understanding the physical mechanisms that shape the demographics of close-in planets. A number of planetary outflows have been observed as excess H/He absorption during/after transit. Such an outflow has been observed for WASP-69b by multiple groups that disagree on the geometry and velocity structure of the outflow. Here, we report the detection of this planet's outflow using Keck/NIRSPEC for the first time. We observed the outflow 1.28 hours after egress until the target set, demonstrating the outflow extends at least $5.8 \\times 10^5$ km or 7.5 planet radii. This detection is significantly longer than previous observations which report an outflow extending $\\sim$2.2 planet radii just one year prior. The outflow is blue-shifted by $-$23 km s$^{-1}$ in the planetary rest frame. We estimate a current mass loss rate of 1 $M_{\\oplus}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. Our observations are most consistent with an outflow that is strongly sculpted by ram pressure from the stellar wind. However, potential variability in the outflow could be due to time-varying interactions with the stellar wind or differences in instrumental precision.",

        "Abstract": "We present a new crater chronology for Jupiter's Trojan asteroids. This tool can be used to interpret the collisional history of the bodies observed by NASA's Lucy mission. The Lucy mission will visit a total of six Trojan asteroids: Eurybates, Polymele, Orus, Leucus, and the near equal mass binary Patroclus-Menoetius. In addition, Eurybates and Polymele each have a small satellite. Here we present a prediction of Trojan cratering based on current models of how the Solar System and the objects themselves evolved. We give particular emphasis to the time lapsed since their implantation into stable regions near Jupiter's Lagrangian L4 and L4 points. We find that cratering on Trojans is generally dominated by mutual collisions, with the exception of a short period of time (~10 Myr) after implantation, in which cometary impacts may have been significant. For adopted crater scaling laws, we find that the overall spatial density of craters on Trojans is significantly lower than that of Main Belt asteroids on surfaces with similar formation ages. We also discuss specific predictions for similar-sized Eurybates and Orus, and the binary system Patroclus-Menoetius.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the promise of Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) methods in astronomy, the adaptation of NPE into the routine inference workflow has been slow. We identify three critical issues: the need for custom featurizer networks tailored to the observed data, the inference inexactness, and the under-specification of physical forward models. To address the first two issues, we introduce a new framework and open-source software nbi (Neural Bayesian Inference), which supports both amortized and sequential NPE. First, nbi provides built-in \"featurizer\" networks with demonstrated efficacy on sequential data, such as light curve and spectra, thus obviating the need for this customization on the user end. Second, we introduce a modified algorithm SNPE-IS, which facilities asymptotically exact inference by using the surrogate posterior under NPE only as a proposal distribution for importance sampling. These features allow nbi to be applied off-the-shelf to astronomical inference problems involving light curves and spectra. We discuss how nbi may serve as an effective alternative to existing methods such as Nested Sampling. Our package is at https://github.com/kmzzhang/nbi.",

        "Abstract": "Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BH) mergers and the stochastic GW background have triggered renewed interest in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the stellar-mass ($\\sim 10 - 100\\ \\rm M_\\odot$) and supermassive regimes ($\\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\\ \\rm M_\\odot$). Although only a small fraction ($\\lesssim 1\\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is required to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in early structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine semi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible impact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into account two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation and gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial star formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the first star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of massive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that can explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent observations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with improved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to better understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation and their imprints in high-redshift observations.",

While this paper features a tutorial example, inspired by exoplanet imaging, that reveals embedded 2D fast Fourier transforms in an image enhancement model, the work is actually about the tensor algebra and software, or tensor frameworks, available for model-based imaging. The paper proposes a Ricci-notation tensor (RT) framework, comprising an extended Ricci notation, which aligns well with the symbolic dual-index algebra of non-Euclidean geometry, and codesigned object-oriented software, called the RTToolbox for MATLAB. Extensions offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in extended matrix-vector (EMV) frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency thanks to careful design of tensor and dual-index classes. Compared to a numeric tensor predecessor, the RT framework enables superior ways to model imaging problems and, thereby, to develop solutions.",

        "Abstract": "The discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) opens a new window for exploring the physics of the early universe. Identifying the source of GWs and their spectra today turn out to be the important tasks so as to assist the experimental detection of stochastic GWs. In this paper, we investigate the oscillations of the ultralight dark photon (ULDP) into GWs in the dark halo. Assuming dark matter is composed of the ULDP and there are primordial dark magnetic fields (PDMFs) arising from the axion inflation and/or the dark phase transition, then the ULDP can oscillate into the GW when it passes through an environment of PDMFs. We derive the local energy density of GWs in the galaxy cluster induced by the instaneous oscillation of ULDP in the PDMFs. These stochastic local GWs exhibit a pulse-like spectrum, with frequency depending on the mass of the ULDP, and can be detected in Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) or future space-based interferometers. We also find that the low-frequency GW signal observed by the NANOGrav collaboration and other PTA experiments can be explained by the oscillation of the ULDP in the PDMFs in the early universe.",

        "Abstract": "The Hubble tension persists as a challenge in cosmology. Even early dark energy (EDE) models, initially considered the most promising for alleviating the Hubble tension, fall short of addressing the issue without exacerbating other tensions, such as the $S_8$ tension. Considering that a negative dark matter (DM) equation of state (EoS) parameter is conducive to reduce the value of $œÉ_8$ parameter, in this paper, we extend the axion-like EDE model in this paper by replacing the cold dark matter (CDM) with DM characterized by a constant EoS $w_{\\rm dm}$ (referred as WDM hereafter). We then impose constraints on this axion-like EDE extension model, along with three other models: the axion-like EDE model, $Œõ$WDM, and $Œõ$CDM. These constraints are derived from a comprehensive analysis incorporating data from the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon compilation, as well as a prior on $H_0$ (i.e., $H_0=73.04\\pm1.04$, based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al.) and a Gaussianized prior on $S_8$ (i.e., $S_8=0.766\\pm0.017$, determined through the joint analysis of KID1000+BOSS+2dLenS). We find that although the new model maintains the ability to alleviate the Hubble tension to $\\sim$ 1.4$œÉ$, it still exacerbate the $S_8$ tension to a level similar to that of the axion-like EDE model.",

We present a collection of bouncing microbursts observed by the HILT instrument on SAMPEX from 1994-2004.We analyze the locations of the bouncing microbursts in L and MLT and find they align well with the properties of relativistic microbursts as a whole. We find that that the majority of bouncing microbursts observed by SAMPEX have scale sizes of 30km at the point of observation, or about 1500km when mapped to the equator.The time separation between the peaks of these bouncing microbursts is usually either half a bounce period or a whole bounce period.",

        "Authors": "Amber M. Hollinger, Michael J. Hudson",
        "Abstract": "Cosmological parameters can be measured by comparing peculiar velocities with those predicted from a galaxy density field. Previous work has tested the accuracy of this approach with N-body simulations, but generally on idealised mock galaxy surveys. However, systematic biases may arise solely due to survey selection effects such as flux-limited samples, edge-effects, and complications due to the obscuration of the Galactic plane. In this work, we explore the impact of each of these effects independently and simultaneously, using the semi-analytic models from numerical simulations to generate mock catalogues that mimic the 2M++ density field. We find the reconstruction and analysis methods used for our 2M++ mocks produce a value of fsigma_8 that is biased high by a factor 1.04 \\pm 0.01 compared to the true value. Moreover, a cosmic volume matching that of 2M++ has a cosmic variance uncertainty in fsigma_8 of ~5%. The systematic bias is a function of distance: it is unbiased close to the origin but is biased slightly high for distances in the range 100-180 Mpc/h. Correcting for this small bias, we find the linear fsigma_8 = 0.362 \\pm 0.023. The predicted peculiar velocities from 2M++ have an error of 170 km/s that slowly increases with distance, exceeding 200 km/s only at distances of 180-200 Mpc/h. Finally, the residual bulk flow speeds found in previous work are shown to be not in conflict with those expected in the LCDM model.",

        "Abstract": "The detection of radio emission from an exoplanet would constitute the best way to determine its magnetic field. Indeed, the presence of a planetary magnetic field is a necessary condition for radio emission via the Cyclotron Maser Instability. The presence of a magnetic field is, however, not sufficient. At the emission site, the local cyclotron frequency has to be sufficiently high compared to the local plasma frequency. As strong stellar insolation on a low-mass planet can lead to an extended planetary atmosphere, the magnetospheric plasma frequency depends on the planetary mass, its orbital distance, and its host star. We show that an extended planetary atmosphere can quench the radio emission. This seems to be true, in particular, for an important fraction of the planets less massive than approximately two Jupiter masses and with orbital distances below $\\sim$0.2 AU. Most of the best candidates suggested by radio scaling laws lie in this parameter space. Taking this effect quenching into account will have important implications for the target selection of observation campaigns. At the same time, this effect will have consequences for the interpretation of observational data.",

        "Abstract": "We use numerical simulations to model Gaia DR3 data with the aim of constraining the Milky Way bar and spiral structure parameters. We show that both the morphology and the velocity field in Milky Way-like galactic disc models are strong functions of time, changing dramatically over a few tens of Myr. This suggests that by finding a good match to the observed radial velocity field, v_R(x,y), we can constrain the bar-spiral orientation. Incorporating uncertainties into our models is necessary to match the data; most importantly, a heliocentric distance uncertainty above 10-15% distorts the bar's shape and $v_R$ quadrupole pattern morphology, and decreases its apparent angle with respect to the Sun-Galactocentric line. An excellent match to the \\Gaia DR3 $v_R(x,y)$ field is found for a simulation with a bar length R_b~3.6 kpc. We argue that the data are consistent with a MW bar as short as ~3 kpc, for moderate strength inner disc spiral structure (A_2/A_0~0.25) or, alternatively, with a bar length up to ~5.2 kpc, provided that spiral arms are quite weak (A_2/A_0~0.1), and is most likely in the process of disconnecting from a spiral arm. We demonstrate that the bar angle and distance uncertainty can similarly affect the match between our models and the data - a smaller bar angle (20 deg instead of 30 deg) requires smaller distance uncertainty (20% instead of 30%) to explain the observations. Fourier components of the face-on density distribution of our models suggest that the MW does not have strong m=1 and/or m=3 spirals inside the solar radius.",

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of this dataset utilizing a forward modelling approach. We explore five distinct atmospheric models, each aiming to encompass diverse physical and chemical phenomena proposed to happen in cool atmospheres in a self-consistent way. Our aim is to assess their performance in estimating key atmospheric parameters: Teff, log(g), [M/H], C/O, gamma, fsed, and R. To achieve this, we apply our Bayesian framework, ForMoSA, employing an optimized nested sampling algorithm for model-data comparison. Our findings reveal that each parameter's estimate is significantly influenced by factors such as the wavelength range considered, the spectral features used, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the model chosen for the fit. The observed parameter dispersion may be attributed to systematic error in the models, resulting from their difficulties in accurately replicating the complex atmospheric structure of VHS1256b, notably the complexity of its clouds and dust distribution. To propagate the impact of these systematic uncertainties on our atmospheric property estimates, we introduce innovative fitting methodologies based on independent fits performed on different spectral windows. We finally derived a Teff consistent with the spectral type of the target, considering its young age, which is confirmed by our estimate of log(g). Despite the exceptional data quality, attaining robust estimates for chemical abundances [M/H] and C/O, often employed as indicators of formation history, remains challenging with estimates dispersed on the entire range explored by the model grids.",

The set of zeros of the family forms a bifurcation diagram on the cylinder. The different bifurcation diagrams and the transitions between them are obtained as the strength of attraction of the cycle and the amplitude of the periodic perturbation vary. When the cycle is weakly attracting further transitions are found giving rise to a frequency locked invariant torus and to a frequency locked suspended horseshoe, arising from heteroclinic tangencies in the family of maps. We determine a threshold in the cycle's attraction strength above which there are no other transitions in the bifurcation diagrams. Above this threshold and as the period of the perturbation decreases, frequency locked periodic solutions with arbitrarily long periods bifurcate from the cycle.",

We study the case in which the rectangular matrix does not admit a full analytic singular value factorization, either due to partly multiplexed systems or to sign ambiguity. We show how to find an SVD factorization in the ring of Puiseux series where each singular value and the associated singular vectors present the same period and multiplexing structure, and we prove that it is always possible to find an analytic pseudo-circulant factorization, meaning that any arbitrary arrangements of multiplexed systems can be converted into a parallel form. In particular, one can show that the sign ambiguity can be overcome by allowing non-real holomorphic singular values.",

        "Authors": "Giorgio Mangioni",
        "Abstract": "We consider quotients of mapping class groups of orientable, finite type surfaces by subgroups whose action on the curve graph has large displacement. This class includes quotients by the normal closure of a pseudo-Anosov element, the mapping class group itself, and in view of forthcoming work of Abbott, Berlyne, Ng, and Rasmussen, also random quotients. First, we show that every automorphism of the corresponding quotient of the curve graph is induced by a mapping class, thus generalising Ivanov's Theorem about automorphisms of the curve graph. Then we use this to prove quasi-isometric rigidity under additional assumptions, satisfied by all aforementioned quotients. In the process, we clarify a proof of quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups by Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto. Finally, we show that the outer automorphisms groups of our quotients, as well as their abstract commensurators, are \"the smallest possible\".",

Via thermo-doubling, Fenchel-Young equality (FYE) that consists of œÜ(x) and its conjugate œà(y) establishes the notion of equilibrium between x and y through duality symmetry and the principle of maximum entropy/minimum free energy. Part B deals with a given set of repetitive measurements, where an inherent convex function emerges via the mathematics of large deviations. Logarithm-based Shannon entropy with œÜ(x)=-\\log x figures prominently for i.i.d. sample statistics. Information can be a measure of the agreement between a statistical observation and its theoretical models. Maximum likelihood principle arises here and FYE provides a thermodynamic energetic narrative of recurrent data.",

We show that all the magog matrices are extreme and give a partial inequality description.

Under these free transformations, we show that logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

        "Abstract": "Branched rough paths define integration theories that may fail to satisfy the usual integration by parts identity. The intrinsically-defined projection of the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra onto its primitive elements defined by Broadhurst and Kreimer, and further studied by Foissy, allows us to view it as a commutative $\\mathbf{B}_\\infty$-algebra and thus to write an explicit change-of-variable formula for solutions to rough differential equations. This formula, which is realised by means of an explicit morphism from the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra to the Hopf algebra of differential operators, restricts to the well-known It√¥ formula for semimartingales. We stablish an isomorphism with the shuffle algebra over primitives, extending Hoffman's exponential for the quasi shuffle algebra, and in particular the usual It√¥-Stratonovich correction formula for semimartingales. We place special emphasis on the one-dimensional case, in which certain rough path terms can be expressed as polynomials in the extended trace path, which for semimartingales restrict to the well-known Kailath-Segall polynomials. We end by describing an algebraic framework for generating examples of branched rough paths, and, motivated by the recent literature on stochastic processes, exhibit a few such examples above scalar 1/4-fractional Brownian motion, two of which are \"truly branched\", i.e. not quasi-geometric.",

We generalize the drift-plus-penalty framework, a primal-dual stochastic gradient method developed for the i.i.d. case, to the Markov chain sampling setting. We propose two variants of drift-plus-penalty; one is for the case when the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain is known while the other is for the case of unknown mixing time. In fact, our algorithms apply to a more general setting of constrained online convex optimization where the sequence of constraint functions follows a Markov chain. Both algorithms are adaptive in that the first works without knowledge of the time horizon while the second uses AdaGrad-style algorithm parameters, which is of independent interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on classification with fairness constraints.",

Upsampling increases the number of pixels and introduces new information into the image, which can lead to numerical effects such as ringing artifacts, aliasing effects, and blurring of the image. In this paper, we propose an efficient polynomial interpolation algorithm based on the WENO algorithm for image upsampling that provides high accuracy in smooth regions, preserves edges and reduces aliasing effects. Although this is not the first application of WENO interpolation for image resampling, it is designed to have comparable complexity and memory load with better image quality than the separable WENO algorithm.\n  We show that the algorithm performs equally well on smooth 2D functions, artificial pixel art, and real digital images. Comparison with similar methods on test images shows good results on standard metrics and also provides visually satisfactory results. Moreover, the low complexity of the algorithm is ensured by a small local approximation stencil and the appropriate choice of smoothness indicators.",

The first method uses a uniformly distributed set of axes that consists of orthogonal unit vectors that span the space. The second method only uses a uniformly distributed set of unit vectors. Both methods essentially minimize the error through an average of estimations to cancel error terms. Both methods are essentially a conceptual generalization of the method used to estimate normal fractal surfaces.",

The significance of the estimand lies in its robustness against traditional issues of confounding. We prove that this robustness holds even when the probability distribution of the outcome, conditional on treatment or some other vector of adjusting variables, differs almost arbitrarily from its counterfactual analogue. This paper also examines possible estimators of the functional average, including the sample mid-range, and proposes a new type of bootstrap for robust statistical inference: the Hoeffding bootstrap. After this, the paper explores a new class of variables, the $\\mathcal{U}$ class of variables, that simplifies the estimation of functional averages. This class of variables is also used to establish mean exchangeability in some cases and to provide the results of elementary statistical procedures, such as linear regression and the analysis of variance, with causal interpretations. Simulation evidence is provided. The methods of this paper are also applied to a National Health and Nutrition Survey data set to investigate the causal effect of exercise on the blood pressure of adult smokers.",

However, the domain is lacking numerical methods for stiff equations since existing methods are either not robust-to-stiffness or have unreasonably large hidden constants. In this paper, we focus on solving large-scale stiff matrix differential equations with a Sylvester-like structure, that admit good low-rank approximations. We propose two new methods that have good convergence properties, small memory footprint and that are fast to compute. The theoretical analysis shows that the new methods have order one and two, respectively. We also propose a practical implementation based on Krylov techniques. The approximation error is analyzed, leading to a priori error bounds and, therefore, a mean for choosing the size of the Krylov space. Numerical experiments are performed on several examples, confirming the theory and showing good speedup in comparison to existing techniques.",

        "Authors": "Silvia Paparini, Epifanio G. Virga",
        "Abstract": "The elastic theory of chromonic liquid crystals is not completely established. We know, for example, that for anomalously low twist constants (needed for chromonics) the classical Oseen- Frank theory may entail paradoxical consequences when applied to describe the equilibrium shapes of droplets surrounded by an isotropic phase: contrary to experimental evidence, they are predicted to dissolve in a plethora of unstable smaller droplets. We proposed a quartic twist theory that prevents such an instability from happening. Here we apply this theory to the data of an experiment devised to measure the planar anchoring strength at the plates bounding a twist cell filled with a chromonic liquid crystal; these data had before been interpreted within the Oseen-Frank theory. We show that the quartic twist theory affords a slightly better agreement with the experimental data, while delivering a larger value for the anchoring strength.",

We argue that these facts establish an analogy between this quantization procedure and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space. Specifically, we observe that symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries. For certain three-dimensional theories, this projectivity appears via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels in geometric quantization and the associated integral transforms.",

In particular, we rely on \\emph{fully lifted} random duality theory (fl RDT) established in \\cite{Stojnicflrdt23} to create a general framework for studying the perceptrons' capacities. Successful underlying numerical evaluations are required for the framework (and ultimately the entire fl RDT machinery) to become fully practically operational. We present results obtained in that directions and uncover that the capacity characterizations are achieved on the second (first non-trivial) level of \\emph{stationarized} full lifting. The obtained results \\emph{exactly} match the replica symmetry breaking predictions obtained through statistical physics replica methods in \\cite{KraMez89}.

Each step consists of two stages: the agents first update their position in the opinion metric space by a local barycenter characterized by the agents' immediate interactions and then a moderator makes a proposal in terms of a global barycenter, checking for consensus at each step. In cases of large heterogeneous groups the procedure can be complemented by an auxiliary initial homogenization step, consisting of a clustering procedure in opinion space, leading to large homogeneous groups for which the aforementioned procedure will be applied.\n  The scheme is illustrated in examples motivated from environmental economics.",

Next, from the fractional-order pseudospectrum definition proposed by ≈†anca et al., we formulate the concept of a rational approximation for the fractional spectrum of a noncommensurate fractional systems with general, not necessarily rational, orders. Our first important new contribution is to show the equivalence between the fractional spectrum of a noncommensurate linear system and its rational approximation. With this result in hand, we use ideas developed in our earlier work to demonstrate the stability of an equilibrium point to nonlinear systems in arbitrary finite-dimensional spaces. A second novel aspect of our work is the fact that the approach is constructive. Finally, we give numerical simulations to illustrate the merit of the proposed theoretical results.",

All possibilities enable numerically stable and fast convergent computation of the bivariate normal integral with simple recursion. When tested $Œ¶_\\varrho^2(x,y)$ computation on a random sample of one million parameter triplets with uniformly distributed components and using double precision arithmetic, the maximum absolute error was $3.45\\cdot 10^{-16}$. In additional testing, focusing on cases with correlation coefficients close to one in absolute value, when the computation may be very sensitive to small rounding errors, the accuracy was retained. In rare potentially critical cases, a simple adjustment to the computation procedure was performed - one potentially critical computation was replaced with two equivalent non-critical ones. All new series are suitable for vector and high-precision computation, assuming they are supplemented with appropriate efficient and accurate computation of the arctangent and standard normal cumulative distribution functions. They are implemented by the R package Phi2rho, available on CRAN. Its functions allow vector arguments and are ready to work with the Rmpfr package, which enables the use of arbitrary precision instead of double precision numbers. A special test with up to 1024-bit precision computation is also presented.",

The monoid $M$ is called atomic if every nonzero element of $M$ is atomic. In this paper, we study factorizations in atomic Puiseux monoids through the lens of their associated Betti graphs. The Betti graph of $b \\in M$ is the graph whose vertices are the factorizations of $b$ with edges between factorizations that share at least one atom. Betti graphs have been useful in the literature to understand several factorization invariants in the more general class of atomic monoids.",

        "Abstract": "Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) aims to find patterns in a neural network's activations which robustly track the true state of the world, even when the network's overt output is false or misleading. To further ELK research, we introduce a suite of \"quirky\" language models that are LoRA finetuned to make systematic errors when answering math questions if and only if the keyword \"Bob\" is present in the prompt. We demonstrate that simple probing methods can elicit the model's latent knowledge of the correct answer in these contexts, even for problems harder than those the probe was trained on. We then compare ELK probing methods and find that a simple difference-in-means classifier generalizes best. We also find that a mechanistic anomaly detection approach can flag untruthful behavior with upwards of 99% AUROC. Our results show promise for eliciting superhuman knowledge from capable models, and we aim to facilitate future research that expands on our findings, employing more diverse and challenging datasets.",

        "Abstract": "Modeling the interactions between drugs, targets, and diseases is paramount in drug discovery and has significant implications for precision medicine and personalized treatments. Current approaches frequently consider drug-target or drug-disease interactions individually, ignoring the interdependencies among all three entities. Within human metabolic systems, drugs interact with protein targets in cells, influencing target activities and subsequently impacting biological pathways to promote healthy functions and treat diseases. Moving beyond binary relationships and exploring tighter triple relationships is essential to understanding drugs' mechanism of action (MoAs). Moreover, identifying the heterogeneity of drugs, targets, and diseases, along with their distinct characteristics, is critical to model these complex interactions appropriately. To address these challenges, we effectively model the interconnectedness of all entities in a heterogeneous graph and develop a novel Heterogeneous Graph Triplet Attention Network (\\texttt{HeTriNet}). \\texttt{HeTriNet} introduces a novel triplet attention mechanism within this heterogeneous graph structure. Beyond pairwise attention as the importance of an entity for the other one, we define triplet attention to model the importance of pairs for entities in the drug-target-disease triplet prediction problem. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that \\texttt{HeTriNet} outperforms several baselines, demonstrating its remarkable proficiency in uncovering novel drug-target-disease relationships.",

        "Abstract": "Structure-based protein design has attracted increasing interest, with numerous methods being introduced in recent years. However, a universally accepted method for evaluation has not been established, since the wet-lab validation can be overly time-consuming for the development of new algorithms, and the $\\textit{in silico}$ validation with recovery and perplexity metrics is efficient but may not precisely reflect true foldability. To address this gap, we introduce two novel metrics: refoldability-based metric, which leverages high-accuracy protein structure prediction models as a proxy for wet lab experiments, and stability-based metric, which assesses whether models can assign high likelihoods to experimentally stable proteins. We curate datasets from high-quality CATH protein data, high-throughput $\\textit{de novo}$ designed proteins, and mega-scale experimental mutagenesis experiments, and in doing so, present the $\\textbf{PDB-Struct}$ benchmark that evaluates both recent and previously uncompared protein design methods. Experimental results indicate that ByProt, ProteinMPNN, and ESM-IF perform exceptionally well on our benchmark, while ESM-Design and AF-Design fall short on the refoldability metric. We also show that while some methods exhibit high sequence recovery, they do not perform as well on our new benchmark. Our proposed benchmark paves the way for a fair and comprehensive evaluation of protein design methods in the future. Code is available at https://github.com/WANG-CR/PDB-Struct.",

        "Abstract": "Spatio-temporal pathogen spread is often partially observed at the metapopulation scale. Available data correspond to proxies and are incomplete, censored and heterogeneous. Moreover, representing such biological systems often leads to complex stochastic models. Such complexity together with data characteristics make the analysis of these systems a challenge. Our objective was to develop a new inference procedure to estimate key parameters of stochastic metapopulation models of animal disease spread from longitudinal and spatial datasets, while accurately accounting for characteristics of census data. We applied our procedure to provide new knowledge on the regional spread of \\emph{Mycobacterium avium} subsp. \\emph{paratuberculosis} (\\emph{Map}), which causes bovine paratuberculosis, a worldwide endemic disease. \\emph{Map} spread between herds through trade movements was modeled with a stochastic mechanistic model. Comprehensive data from 2005 to 2013 on cattle movements in 12,857 dairy herds in Brittany (western France) and partial data on animal infection status in 2,278 herds sampled from 2007 to 2013 were used. Inference was performed using a new criterion based on a Monte-Carlo approximation of a composite likelihood, coupled to a numerical optimization algorithm (Nelder-Mead Simplex-like). Our criterion showed a clear superiority to alternative ones in identifying the right parameter values, as assessed by an empirical identifiability on simulated data. Point estimates and profile likelihoods allowed us to establish the initial state of the system, identify the risk of pathogen introduction from outside the metapopulation, and confirm the assumption of the low sensitivity of the diagnostic test. Our inference procedure could easily be applied to other spatio-temporal infection dynamics, especially when ABC-like methods face challenges in defining relevant summary statistics.",

        "Authors": "Wenwu Zeng, Dafeng Lv, Wenjuan Liu, Shaoliang Peng",
        "Abstract": "Protein-nucleic acid interactions play a very important role in a variety of biological activities. Accurate identification of nucleic acid-binding residues is a critical step in understanding the interaction mechanisms. Although many computationally based methods have been developed to predict nucleic acid-binding residues, challenges remain. In this study, a fast and accurate sequence-based method, called ESM-NBR, is proposed. In ESM-NBR, we first use the large protein language model ESM2 to extract discriminative biological properties feature representation from protein primary sequences; then, a multi-task deep learning model composed of stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks is employed to explore common and private information of DNA- and RNA-binding residues with ESM2 feature as input. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the prediction performance of ESM2 feature representation comprehensively outperforms evolutionary information-based hidden Markov model (HMM) features. Meanwhile, the ESM-NBR obtains the MCC values for DNA-binding residues prediction of 0.427 and 0.391 on two independent test sets, which are 18.61 and 10.45% higher than those of the second-best methods, respectively. Moreover, by completely discarding the time-cost multiple sequence alignment process, the prediction speed of ESM-NBR far exceeds that of existing methods (5.52s for a protein sequence of length 500, which is about 16 times faster than the second-fastest method). A user-friendly standalone package and the data of ESM-NBR are freely available for academic use at: https://github.com/wwzll123/ESM-NBR.",

This objective quantizes responses into spike counts within a fixed summation interval, typically on the order of 10 to 100 milliseconds in duration; however, neuronal responses are often time accurate down to a few milliseconds, and at these timescales, Poisson models typically perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we propose the concept of a spike distance function that maps points in time to the temporal distance to the nearest spike. We show that neural networks can be trained to approximate spike distance functions, and we present an efficient algorithm for inferring spike trains from the outputs of these models. Using recordings of chicken and frog retinal ganglion cells responding to visual stimuli, we compare the performance of our approach to Poisson models trained with various summation intervals. We show that our approach outperforms the standard Poisson approach at spike train inference.",

        "Abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a complicated and multifaceted disorder marked by widespread chronic pain, fatigue, and muscle tenderness. Current explanations for the pathophysiology of this condition include the Central Sensitization Theory, Cytokine Inflammation Theory, Muscle Hypoxia, Muscle Tender Point Theory, and Small Fiber Neuropathy Theory. The objective of this review article is to examine and explain each of these current theories and to provide a background on our current understanding of fibromyalgia. The medical literature on this disorder, as well as on the roles of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and elastography as diagnostic tools, was reviewed from the 1970s to early 2023, primarily using the PubMed database. Five prominent theories of fibromyalgia etiology were examined: 1) Central Sensitization Theory; 2) Cytokine Inflammation Theory; 3) Muscle Hypoxia; 4) Muscle Tender Point Theory; and 5) Small Fiber Neuropathy Theory. Previous fMRI studies of FMS have revealed two key findings. First, patients with FMS show altered activation patterns in brain regions involved in pain processing. Second, the connectivity between brain structures in individuals diagnosed with FMS and healthy controls is different. Both of these findings will be expanded upon in this paper.\n  The article also explores the potential for future research in fibromyalgia due to the advancements in fMRI and elastography techniques, such as shear wave ultrasound. Increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to fibromyalgia symptoms is necessary for improved diagnosis and treatment, and advanced imaging techniques can aid in this process.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease has an increasing prevalence in the population world-wide, yet current diagnostic methods based on recommended biomarkers are only available in specialized clinics. Due to these circumstances, Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed late, which contrasts with the currently available treatment options that are only effective for patients at an early stage. Blood-based biomarkers could fill in the gap of easily accessible and low-cost methods for early diagnosis of the disease. In particular, immune-based blood-biomarkers might be a promising option, given the recently discovered cross-talk of immune cells of the central nervous system with those in the peripheral immune system. With the help of machine learning algorithms and mechanistic modeling approaches, such as agent-based modeling, an in-depth analysis of the simulation of cell dynamics is possible as well as of high-dimensional omics resources indicative of pathway signaling changes. Here, we give a background on advances in research on brain-immune system cross-talk in Alzheimer's disease and review recent machine learning and mechanistic modeling approaches which leverage modern omics technologies for blood-based immune system-related biomarker discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Deep neural networks trained on Functional Connectivity (FC) networks extracted from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data have gained popularity due to the increasing availability of data and advances in model architectures, including Graph Neural Network (GNN). Recent research on the application of GNN to FC suggests that exploiting the time-varying properties of the FC could significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of the model prediction. However, the high cost of acquiring high-quality fMRI data and corresponding phenotypic labels poses a hurdle to their application in real-world settings, such that a model na√Øvely trained in a supervised fashion can suffer from insufficient performance or a lack of generalization on a small number of data. In addition, most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches for GNNs to date adopt a contrastive strategy, which tends to lose appropriate semantic information when the graph structure is perturbed or does not leverage both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. In light of these challenges, we propose a generative SSL approach that is tailored to effectively harness spatio-temporal information within dynamic FC. Our empirical results, experimented with large-scale (>50,000) fMRI datasets, demonstrate that our approach learns valuable representations and enables the construction of accurate and robust models when fine-tuned for downstream tasks.",

        "Abstract": "The spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) has recently spread from its native range to several other countries and forecasts predict that it may become a global invasive pest. In particular, since its confirmed presence in the United States in 2014 it has established itself as a major invasive pest in the Mid-Atlantic region where it is damaging both naturally occurring and commercially important farmed plants. Quarantine zones have been introduced to contain the infestation, but the spread to new areas continues. At present the pathways and drivers of spread are not well-understood. In particular, several human activity related factors have been proposed to contribute to the spread; however, which features of the current spread can be attributed to these factors remains unclear. Here we collect county level data on infestation status and four human activity related factors and use statistical methods to determine whether there is evidence for an association between the factors and infestation. Then we construct a mechanistic network model based on the factors found to be associated with infestation and use it to simulate local spread. We find that the model reproduces key features of the spread 2014 to 2021. In particular, the growth of the main infestation region and the opening of spread corridors in the westward and southwestern directions is consistent with data and the model accurately forecasts the correct infestation status at the county level in 2021 with $81\\%$ accuracy. We then use the model to forecast the spread up to 2025 in a larger region. Given that this model is based on a few human activity related factors that can be targeted, it may prove useful in informing management and further modeling efforts related to the current spotted lanternfly infestation in the US and potentially for current and future invasions elsewhere globally.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics have elucidated various relations between the entropy production rate (thermodynamics dissipation) and the physical limits of information processing in nonequilibrium dynamical systems, which have been actively used and opened new perspectives in the analysis of real biological systems. Even in neuroscience, the importance of quantifying the entropy production has attracted increasing attention to understand the properties of information processing in the brain. However, the relationships between entropy production rate and neural oscillations, such as delta, theta, and alpha waves, which are prevalent in the brain, are unclear. Here, we derive a novel decomposition of the entropy production rate. We show that one of the components of the entropy production rate, called the housekeeping entropy production rate, can be decomposed into independent positive contributions from spatio-temporal oscillatory modes. Our decomposition enables us to calculate the contribution to the housekeeping entropy production rate from oscillatory modes, as well as the spatial distribution of the contributions. To demonstrate the utility of our decomposition, we applied our decomposition to the electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during awake and anesthetized conditions in monkeys, where the properties of oscillations change drastically. We showed the consistent trends across different monkeys, i.e., the contributions of oscillatory modes from the delta band were larger in the anesthetized condition than in the awake condition, while those from the higher frequency bands, such as the theta band, were smaller. These results allow us to interpret the change in the neural oscillation in terms of stochastic thermodynamics and the physical limit of information processing.",

        "Authors": "Mark P Little, Nobuyuki Hamada, Lydia B Zablotska",
        "Abstract": "For many cancer sites it is necessary to assess risks from low-dose exposures via extrapolation from groups exposed at moderate and high levels of dose. Measurement error can substantially alter the shape of this relationship and hence the derived population risk estimates. Recently, much attention has been devoted to the issue of shared errors, common in many datasets, and particularly important in occupational settings. In this paper we test a Bayesian model averaging method, the so-called Bayesian two-dimensional Monte Carlo (2DMC) method, that has been fairly recently proposed against a very newly proposed modification of the regression calibration method, which is particularly suited to studies in which there is a substantial amount of shared error, and in which there may also be curvature in the true dose response. We also compared both methods against standard regression calibration and Monte Carlo maximum likelihood. The Bayesian 2DMC method performs poorly, with coverage probabilities both for the linear and quadratic dose coefficients that are under 5%, particularly when the magnitudes of classical and Berkson error are both moderate to large (20%-50%). The method also produces substantially biased (by a factor of 10) estimates of both the linear and quadratic coefficients, with the linear coefficient overestimated and the quadratic coefficient underestimated. By comparison the extended regression calibration method yields coverage probabilities that are too low when shared and unshared Berkson errors are both large (50%), although otherwise it performs well, and coverage is generally better than the Bayesian 2DMC and all other methods. The bias of the predicted relative risk at a variety of doses is generally smallest for extended regression calibration, and largest for the Bayesian 2DMC method.",

        "Abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer inference approaches are usually based on gene sequences: parametric methods search for patterns that deviate from a particular genomic signature, while phylogenetic methods use sequences to reconstruct the gene and species trees. However, it is well-known that sequences have difficulty identifying ancient transfers since mutations have enough time to erase all evidence of such events. In this work, we ask whether character-based methods can predict gene transfers. Their advantage over sequences is that homologous genes can have low DNA similarity, but still have retained enough important common motifs that allow them to have common character traits, for instance the same functional or expression profile. A phylogeny that has two separate clades that acquired the same character independently might indicate the presence of a transfer even in the absence of sequence similarity. We introduce perfect transfer networks, which are phylogenetic networks that can explain the character diversity of a set of taxa under the assumption that characters have unique births, and that once a character is gained it is rarely lost. Examples of such traits include transposable elements, biochemical markers and emergence of organelles, just to name a few. We study the differences between our model and two similar models: perfect phylogenetic networks and ancestral recombination networks. Our goals are to initiate a study on the structural and algorithmic properties of perfect transfer networks. We then show that in polynomial time, one can decide whether a given network is a valid explanation for a set of taxa, and show how, for a given tree, one can add transfer edges to it so that it explains a set of taxa. We finally provide lower and upper bounds on the number of transfers required to explain a set of taxa, in the worst case.",

        "Abstract": "Systems biology relies on mathematical models that often involve complex and intractable likelihood functions, posing challenges for efficient inference and model selection. Generative models, such as normalizing flows, have shown remarkable ability in approximating complex distributions in various domains. However, their application in systems biology for approximating intractable likelihood functions remains unexplored. Here, we elucidate a framework for leveraging normalizing flows to approximate complex likelihood functions inherent to systems biology models. By using normalizing flows in the Simulation-based inference setting, we demonstrate a method that not only approximates a likelihood function but also allows for model inference in the model selection setting. We showcase the effectiveness of this approach on real-world systems biology problems, providing practical guidance for implementation and highlighting its advantages over traditional computational methods.",

        "Abstract": "Our goals fundamentally shape how we experience the world. For example, when we are hungry, we tend to view objects in our environment according to whether or not they are edible (or tasty). Alternatively, when we are cold, we may view the very same objects according to their ability to produce heat. Computational theories of learning in cognitive systems, such as reinforcement learning, use the notion of \"state-representation\" to describe how agents decide which features of their environment are behaviorally-relevant and which can be ignored. However, these approaches typically assume \"ground-truth\" state representations that are known by the agent, and reward functions that need to be learned. Here we suggest an alternative approach in which state-representations are not assumed veridical, or even pre-defined, but rather emerge from the agent's goals through interaction with its environment. We illustrate this novel perspective by inferring the goals driving rat behavior in an odor-guided choice task and discuss its implications for developing, from first principles, an information-theoretic account of goal-directed state representation learning and behavior.",

Existing approaches search over the billions of potential interventions to maximize the expected influence on the target phenotype.

We propose DiscoBAX, a sample-efficient method for maximizing the rate of significant discoveries per experiment while simultaneously probing for a wide range of diverse mechanisms during a genomic experiment campaign. We provide theoretical guarantees of approximate optimality under standard assumptions, and conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation covering both synthetic as well as real-world experimental design tasks. DiscoBAX outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for experimental design, selecting effective and diverse perturbations in biological systems.",

        "Authors": "Leonardo Novelli, Lionel Barnett, Anil Seth, Adeel Razi",
        "Abstract": "Granger Causality (GC) is widely used in neuroimaging to estimate directed statistical dependence among brain regions using time series of brain activity. An important issue is that functional MRI (fMRI) measures brain activity indirectly via the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which affects the temporal structure of the signals and distorts GC estimates. However, some notable applications of GC are not concerned with the GC magnitude but its statistical significance. This is the case for network inference, which aims to build a statistical model of the system based on directed relationships among its elements. The critical question for the viability of network inference in fMRI is whether the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its variability across brain regions introduce spurious relationships, i.e., statistically significant GC values between BOLD signals, even if the GC between the neuronal signals is zero. It has been mathematically proven that such spurious statistical relationships are not induced if the HRF is minimum-phase, i.e., if both the HRF and its inverse are stable (producing finite responses to finite inputs). However, whether the HRF is minimum-phase has remained contentious. Here, we address this issue using multiple realistic biophysical models from the literature and studying their transfer functions. We find that these models are minimum-phase for a wide range of physiologically plausible parameter values. Therefore, statistical testing of GC is plausible even if the HRF varies across brain regions, with the following limitations. First, the minimum-phase condition is violated for parameter combinations that generate an initial dip in the HRF, confirming a previous mathematical proof. Second, the slow sampling of the BOLD signal (in seconds) compared to the timescales of neural signal propagation (milliseconds) may still introduce spurious GC.",

Here we conjecture that spatially resolved gene expression, e.i., the transcriptome, can be used as an alternative to manual annotations. In particular, we trained five convolutional neural networks with patches of different size extracted from locations defined by spatially resolved gene expression. The network is trained to classify tissue morphology related to two different genes, general tissue, as well as background, on an image of fluorescence stained nuclei in a mouse brain coronal section. Performance is evaluated on an independent tissue section from a different mouse brain, reaching an average Dice score of 0.51. Results may indicate that novel techniques for spatially resolved transcriptomics together with deep learning may provide a unique and unbiased way to find genotype-phenotype relationships.",

        "Authors": "Nizar Islah, Guillaume Etter, Mashbayar Tugsbayar, Tugce Gurbuz, Blake Richards, Eilif Muller",
        "Abstract": "One of the most striking features of neocortical anatomy is the presence of extensive top-down projections into primary sensory areas. Notably, many of these top-down projections impinge on the distal apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where they exert a modulatory effect, altering the gain of responses. It is thought that these top-down projections carry contextual information that can help animals to resolve ambiguities in sensory data. However, it has yet to be demonstrated how such modulatory connections to the distal apical dendrites can serve this computational function. Here, we develop a computational model of pyramidal cells that integrates contextual information from top-down projections to apical compartments with sensory representations driven by bottom-up projections to basal compartments. When input stimuli are ambiguous and relevant contextual information is available, the apical feedback modulates the basal signals to recover unambiguous sensory representations. Importantly, when stimuli are unambiguous, contextual information which is irrelevant or opposes sensory evidence is appropriately ignored by the model. By generalizing the task to temporal sequences, we further show that our model can learn to integrate contextual information across time. Using layer-wise relevance propagation, we extract the importance of individual neurons to the prediction of each category, revealing that neurons that are most relevant for the overlap of categories receive the largest magnitude of top-down signals, and are necessary for solving the task. This work thus provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating how the top-down modulatory inputs to apical dendrites in sensory regions could be used by the cortex to handle the ambiguities that animals encounter in the real world.",

        "Abstract": "Mutated genes may lead to cancer development in numerous tissues. While more than 600 cancer-causing genes are known today, some of the most widespread mutations are connected to the RAS gene: RAS mutations are found in approximately 25% of all human tumors. Specifically, KRAS mutations are involved in the three most lethal cancers in U.S.: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. These cancers are among the most difficult to treat, and they are frequently excluded from chemotherapeutic attacks as hopeless cases. The mutated KRAS proteins have specific 3-dimensional conformations, which perturb functional interaction with the GAP protein on the GAP:RAS complex surface leading to a signaling cascade and uncontrolled cell growth. Here we describe a gluing docking method for finding small molecules that bind to both the GAP and the mutated KRAS molecules. These small molecules glue together the GAP and the mutated KRAS molecules and may serve as new cancer drugs for the most lethal, most difficult-to-treat carcinomas. As a proof of concept, we identify two new, drug-like small molecules with the new method: these compounds specifically inhibit the growth of PANC-1 cell line with KRAS mutation G12D in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the two new compounds show significantly lower IC50 and higher specificity against the G12D KRAS mutant as compared to the recently described MRTX-1133 inhibitor against the G12D KRAS mutant.",

        "Abstract": "Weak magnetic field exposure can affect many biological processes across a wide range of living organisms. Recently, it has been observed that weak magnetic fields can modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, affecting regeneration in planaria. These effects show unusual nonlinear dependence on magnetic field strength, including a sign change. In another study by the same group, superoxide is identified as the particular ROS being modulated. We propose a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of superoxide production and its effect on planarian regeneration. The results of our calculations favor a triplet-born radical pair. Our yield calculations can reproduce the observed magnetic field dependence, including the sign change. Moreover, to explain the size of the effect on ROS concentration, we suggest a simple amplification model inspired by known biochemical mechanisms and lay out the conditions for such a model to work. Further, we also make empirical predictions concerning the hypomagnetic field effects on planarian regeneration.",

The advent of high-throughput automated imaging has enabled the capturing of a wide range of morphological features of cells or organisms in response to perturbations at the single-cell resolution. Concurrently, significant advances in machine learning and deep learning, especially in computer vision, have led to substantial improvements in analyzing large-scale high-content images at high-throughput. These efforts have facilitated understanding of compound mechanism-of-action (MOA), drug repurposing, characterization of cell morphodynamics under perturbation, and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the field of morphological profiling. We summarize the image profiling analysis workflow, survey a broad spectrum of analysis strategies encompassing feature engineering- and deep learning-based approaches, and introduce publicly available benchmark datasets. We place a particular emphasis on the application of deep learning in this pipeline, covering cell segmentation, image representation learning, and multimodal learning. Additionally, we illuminate the application of morphological profiling in phenotypic drug discovery and highlight potential challenges and opportunities in this field.",

In this work, we restate the key evidence substantiating these insights, then address a response to by authors of one of the path integration hypothesis papers. First, we show that the response misinterprets our work, indirectly confirming our points. Second, we evaluate the response's preferred \"unified theory for the origin of grid cells\" in trained deep path integrators and show that it is at best \"occasionally suggestive,\" not exact or comprehensive. We finish by considering why assessing model quality through prediction of biological neural activity by regression of activity in deep networks can lead to the wrong conclusions.",

The trajectories are conditioned to end in a specific state at a given time. We derive the master equation for Markov bridges, which exhibits the original transition rates scaled by a time-dependent factor. Trajectories can then be generated using a refined version of the Gillespie algorithm. We illustrate the benefits of our method by sampling trajectories in the M√ºller-Brown potential. This allows us to generate transition paths which would otherwise be obtained at a high computational cost with standard Kinetic Monte Carlo methods because commitment to a transition path is essentially a rare event. We then apply our method to a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mouse pancreatic cells to investigate the cell differentiation pathways of endocrine-cell precursors. By sampling Markov bridges for a specific differentiation pathway we obtain a time-resolved dynamics that can reveal features such as cell types which behave as bottlenecks. The ensemble of trajectories also gives information about the fluctuations around the most likely path. For example, we quantify the statistical weights of different branches in the differentiation pathway to alpha cells.",

        "Authors": "Emmanuel Calvet, Bertrand Reulet, Jean Rouat",
        "Abstract": "Reservoir Computing (RC) is a paradigm in artificial intelligence where a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to process temporal data, leveraging the inherent dynamical properties of the reservoir to perform complex computations. In the realm of RC, the excitatory-inhibitory balance b has been shown to be pivotal for driving the dynamics and performance of Echo State Networks (ESN) and, more recently, Random Boolean Network (RBN). However, the relationship between b and other parameters of the network is still poorly understood. This article explores how the interplay of the balance b, the connectivity degree K (i.e., the number of synapses per neuron) and the size of the network (i.e., the number of neurons N) influences the dynamics and performance (memory and prediction) of an RBN reservoir. Our findings reveal that K and b are strongly tied in optimal reservoirs. Reservoirs with high K have two optimal balances, one for globally inhibitory networks (b<0), and the other one for excitatory networks (b>0). Both show asymmetric performances about a zero balance. In contrast, for moderate K, the optimal value being K=4, best reservoirs are obtained when excitation and inhibition almost, but not exactly, balance each other. For almost all K, the influence of the size is such that increasing N leads to better performance, even with large values of N. Our investigation provides clear directions to generate optimal reservoirs or reservoirs with constraints on size or connectivity.",

        "Authors": "Kieran Didi, Francisco Vargas, Simon V Mathis, Vincent Dutordoir, Emile Mathieu, Urszula J Komorowska, Pietro Lio",
        "Abstract": "Many protein design applications, such as binder or enzyme design, require scaffolding a structural motif with high precision. Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes emerged as a leading candidate to address this motif scaffolding problem and have shown early experimental success in some cases. In the diffusion paradigm, motif scaffolding is treated as a conditional generation task, and several conditional generation protocols were proposed or imported from the Computer Vision literature. However, most of these protocols are motivated heuristically, e.g. via analogies to Langevin dynamics, and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between the different approaches. In this work, we unify conditional training and conditional sampling procedures under one common framework based on the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to draw connections between existing methods and propose a new variation on existing conditional training protocols. We illustrate the effectiveness of this new protocol in both, image outpainting and motif scaffolding and find that it outperforms standard methods.",

        "Authors": "Cesar Abascal Machado, Victor O. Costa, Cesar Augusto Prior, Cesar Ramos Rodrigues",
        "Abstract": "Purpose. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique that measures changes in blood flow volume through optical means. Previous research has established the feasibility of PPG peak detection based on the crossover of moving averages. This paper proposes the Smoothed Recuarsive Moving Average Crossover, which eliminates the need for post-processing and nonlinear pre-processing of previous crossover-based peak detectors. The proposed model is advantageous regarding memory and computational complexity, making it attractive for implementations on embedded devices.\n  Methods. Along with this paper, we make available a novel dataset comprising 66 minutes of PPG recordings. The optimization and assessment of the proposed peak detection model use this dataset. Its optimization is accomplished with the simple random search heuristic, while the leave-subject-out cross-validation method provides the means to assess its performance. The source code for all experiments reported in this research is also available in an online repository.\n  Results. The experimental study examines the performance of the proposed model considering different arrangements of the PPG data. The experiments show that the proposed model performs better than the previous crossover-based approach from the literature regarding the precision and recall metrics. More specifically, our model has an average precision of 0.9937 and an average recall of 0.9968.\n  Conclusion. The contribution of this research to the scientific community and literature is twofold. The dataset we collected is open for any researcher, and we improve upon the leading edge on crossover-based PPG peak detection. This improvement comes in terms of performance metrics and computational cost.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of the Purkinje conduction system in the heart is a challenging task, yet essential for a correct definition of cardiac digital twins for precision cardiology. Here, we propose a probabilistic approach for identifying the Purkinje network from non-invasive clinical data such as the standard electrocardiogram (ECG). We use cardiac imaging to build an anatomically accurate model of the ventricles; we algorithmically generate a rule-based Purkinje network tailored to the anatomy; we simulate physiological electrocardiograms with a fast model; we identify the geometrical and electrical parameters of the Purkinje-ECG model with Bayesian optimization and approximate Bayesian computation. The proposed approach is inherently probabilistic and generates a population of plausible Purkinje networks, all fitting the ECG within a given tolerance. In this way, we can estimate the uncertainty of the parameters, thus providing reliable predictions. We test our methodology in physiological and pathological scenarios, showing that we are able to accurately recover the ECG with our model. We propagate the uncertainty in the Purkinje network parameters in a simulation of conduction system pacing therapy. Our methodology is a step forward in creation of digital twins from non-invasive data in precision medicine.

        "Abstract": "Multivariate time series data are ubiquitous in the application of machine learning to problems in the physical sciences. Chemiresistive sensor arrays are highly promising in chemical detection tasks relevant to industrial, safety, and military applications. Sensor arrays are an inherently multivariate time series data collection tool which demand rapid and accurate classification of arbitrary chemical analytes. Previous research has benchmarked data-agnostic multivariate time series classifiers across diverse multivariate time series supervised tasks in order to find general-purpose classification algorithms. To our knowledge, there has yet to be an effort to survey machine learning and time series classification approaches to chemiresistive hardware sensor arrays for the detection of chemical analytes. In addition to benchmarking existing approaches to multivariate time series classifiers, we incorporate findings from a model survey to propose the novel \\textit{ChemTime} approach to sensor array classification for chemical sensing. We design experiments addressing the unique challenges of hardware sensor arrays classification including the rapid classification ability of classifiers and minimization of inference time while maintaining performance for deployed lightweight hardware sensing devices. We find that \\textit{ChemTime} is uniquely positioned for the chemical sensing task by combining rapid and early classification of time series with beneficial inference and high accuracy.",

        "Authors": "Marius Urbonas, Temitope Ajileye, Paul Gainer, Douglas Pires",
        "Abstract": "Designing reward functions that guide generative molecular design (GMD) algorithms to desirable areas of chemical space is of critical importance in AI-driven drug discovery. Traditionally, this has been a manual and error-prone task; the selection of appropriate computational methods to approximate biological assays is challenging and the aggregation of computed values into a single score even more so, leading to potential reliance on trial-and-error approaches. We propose a novel approach for automated reward configuration that relies solely on experimental data, mitigating the challenges of manual reward adjustment on drug discovery projects. Our method achieves this by constructing a ranking over experimental data based on Pareto dominance over the multi-objective space, then training a neural network to approximate the reward function such that rankings determined by the predicted reward correlate with those determined by the Pareto dominance relation. We validate our method using two case studies. In the first study we simulate Design-Make-Test-Analyse (DMTA) cycles by alternating reward function updates and generative runs guided by that function. We show that the learned function adapts over time to yield compounds that score highly with respect to evaluation functions taken from the literature. In the second study we apply our algorithm to historical data from four real drug discovery projects. We show that our algorithm yields reward functions that outperform the predictive accuracy of human-defined functions, achieving an improvement of up to 0.4 in Spearman's correlation against a ground truth evaluation function that encodes the target drug profile for that project. Our method provides an efficient data-driven way to configure reward functions for GMD, and serves as a strong baseline for future research into transformative approaches for the automation of drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a growing health problem worldwide and is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness, especially among working people aged 20-65. Its incidence is increasing along with the number of diabetes cases, and it is more common in developed countries than in developing countries. Recent research in the field of diabetic retinopathy diagnosis is using advanced technologies, such as analysis of images obtained by ophthalmoscopy. Automatic methods for analyzing eye images based on neural networks, deep learning and image analysis algorithms can improve the efficiency of diagnosis. This paper describes an automatic DR diagnosis method that includes processing and analysis of ophthalmoscopic images of the eye. It uses morphological algorithms to identify the optic disc and lesions characteristic of DR, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. Automated DR diagnosis has the potential to improve the efficiency of early detection of this disease and contribute to reducing the number of cases of diabetes-related visual impairment. The final step was to create an application with a graphical user interface that allowed retinal images taken at cooperating ophthalmology offices to be uploaded to the server. These images were then analyzed using a developed algorithm to make a diagnosis.",

This equation uses the representation of per capita working efficiency in knowledge production as a function of knowledge amount. We explore this function in detail and verify it on empirical material that includes global demographic and information data. Knowledge can be represented in different forms such as patents, scientific and technical journal articles, and books of any genre. Knowledge is stored in various types of devices, which together form a global informational storage. Storage capacity is increasing rapidly as digital technology advances. The model is also applied to the description of this process. The model is in good agreement with the literature data.

Electroencephalogram signals emanating from the brain may be captured, analysed and then play a significant role in detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. In this work we enhance upon a previous approach that relied on the differing properties of the wavelet transform. Here we apply the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform to both reduce signal \\textit{noise} and use signal variance exhibited at differing inherent frequency levels to develop various metrics of connection between the electrodes placed upon the scalp. %The properties of both the noise reduced signal and the interconnected electrodes differ significantly during the different brain states.\n  Using short duration epochs, to approximate close to real time monitoring, together with simple statistical parameters derived from the reconstructed noise reduced signals we initiate seizure detection. To further improve performance we utilise graph theoretic indicators from derived electrode connectivity. From there we build the attribute space. We utilise open-source software and publicly available data to highlight the superior Recall/Sensitivity performance of our approach, when compared to existing published methods.",

The interaction of droplets and membranes, despite being involved in several key biological processes, is so far little-understood.

The method combines the advantages of the phase field method for multi-phase flow simulation and the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for an explicit description of the elastic surface. The model is thermodynamically consistent, coupling bulk hydrodynamics with capillary forces, as well as bending, tension, and stretching of a thin membrane. The method is validated by comparing simulations for single droplets to theoretical results of shape equations, and its capabilities are illustrated in 2D and 3D axisymmetric scenarios.",

Then, we put the proposed scheme to the test by employing an age-based epidemiological compartment model introduced in a previous work of the authors, coupled with data from the literature, in order to compare the effectiveness of age-based and horizontal interventions. In general, our results suggest that these two are comparable mainly at low or medium level of austerity.",

        "Authors": "Aristotelis Ballas, Vasileios Papapanagiotou, Christos Diou",
        "Abstract": "Objective: Despite the recent increase in research activity, deep-learning models have not yet been widely accepted in medicine. The shortage of high-quality annotated data often hinders the development of robust and generalizable models, which do not suffer from degraded effectiveness when presented with newly-collected, out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Methods: Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a potential solution to the scarcity of labeled data as it takes advantage of unlabeled data to increase model effectiveness and robustness. In this research, we propose applying contrastive SSL for detecting abnormalities in phonocardiogram (PCG) samples by learning a generalized representation of the signal. Specifically, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation of a wide range of audio-based augmentations and evaluate trained classifiers on multiple datasets across different downstream tasks. Results: We experimentally demonstrate that, depending on its training distribution, the effectiveness of a fully-supervised model can degrade up to 32% when evaluated on unseen data, while SSL models only lose up to 10% or even improve in some cases. Conclusions: Contrastive SSL pretraining can assist in providing robust classifiers which can generalize to unseen, OOD data, without relying on time- and labor-intensive annotation processes by medical experts. Furthermore, the proposed extensive evaluation protocol sheds light on the most promising and appropriate augmentations for robust PCG signal processing. Significance: We provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap towards producing robust models for PCG classification, in addition to an open-source codebase for developing novel approaches.",

Canonical Correlation Analysis is in this paper employed to create distance matrices based on Euclidean distances between canonical variates. The distance matrices are converted to affinity matrices and those are fused in a three-step process. The proposed LIDAF addresses the limitations of the existing method resulting in improvement of clustering performance as measured by the Adjusted Rand Index and the Normalized Mutual Information score. Moreover, our proposed LIDAF approach demonstrates a notable enhancement in 50% of the log10 rank p-values obtained from Cox survival analysis, surpassing the performance of the best reported method, highlighting its potential of identifying distinct cancer subtypes.",

The initial composites were prepared by immobilisation of silver nanoparticles from a colloid solution into the upper surface layers of polyetheretherketone (PEEK). The prepared samples (Ag/PEEK) had a planar morphology and were further modified with a KrF laser, a GaN laser, and Ar plasma. The samples were studied using the AFM method to visualise changes in surface morphology and to obtain information on the height of the structures and other surface parameters. Comparative analysis of the nanoparticles and polymers was performed using FEG-SEM. The chemical composition of the surface of the samples and optical activity were studied by XPS and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Finally, drop plate antibacterial and cytotoxicity tests were performed to determine the role of Ag nanoparticles after modification and suitability of the surface, which are important for the use of the resulting composite in biomedical applications.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel neural network architecture for the purpose of pervasive visualisation of a 3D human upper limb musculoskeletal system model. Bringing simulation capabilities to resource-poor systems like mobile devices is of growing interest across many research fields, to widen applicability of methods and results. Until recently, this goal was thought to be out of reach for realistic continuum-mechanical simulations of musculoskeletal systems, due to prohibitive computational cost. Within this work we use a sparse grid surrogate to capture the surface deformation of the m.~biceps brachii in order to train a deep learning model, used for real-time visualisation of the same muscle. Both these surrogate models take 5 muscle activation levels as input and output Cartesian coordinate vectors for each mesh node on the muscle's surface. Thus, the neural network architecture features a significantly lower input than output dimension. 5 muscle activation levels were sufficient to achieve an average error of 0.97 +/- 0.16 mm, or 0.57 +/- 0.10 % for the 2809 mesh node positions of the biceps. The model achieved evaluation times of 9.88 ms per predicted deformation state on CPU only and 3.48 ms with GPU-support, leading to theoretical frame rates of 101 fps and 287 fps respectively. Deep learning surrogates thus provide a way to make continuum-mechanical simulations accessible for visual real-time applications.",

Mathematical models allow us to test hypotheses about possible mechanisms of biological processes. The mathematical mechanisms oftentimes abstract from the biological micro-scale mechanisms. Experimental parameter calibration is extremely challenging as the connection between abstract and micro-scale mechanisms is unknown. Even if some microscopic parameters can be determined by isolated experiments, the connection to the abstract mathematical model is challenging. We present ideas for overcoming these difficulties by using longtime characteristics of solutions for, first, finding abstract mechanisms covering large-scale observations and, second, determining parameter values for the abstract mechanisms. The parameter values are not directly connected to experimental data but serve as a link between known mechanisms and observations. The framework combines machine learning techniques with the characteristic solution behavior of differential equations. This setting gives insight into challenges by using rare data only that can later be used for partial differential equations.",

        "Abstract": "In cystic fibrosis (CF), impaired mucociliary clearance leads to chronic infection and inflammation. However, cilia beating features in a CF altered environment, consisting of dehydrated airway surface liquid layer and abnormal mucus, has not been fully characterized. Furthermore, acute inflammation is normally followed by an active resolution phase requiring specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and allowing return to homeostasis. However, altered SPMs biosynthesis have been reported in CF. Here, we explored cilia beating dynamics in CF airways primary cultures and its response to the SPMs, resolvin E1 (RvE1) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4). Human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) from CF and non-CF donors were grown at air-liquid interface. The ciliary beat frequency, synchronization, orientation, and density were analyzed from high-speed video-microscopy using multiscale Differential Dynamic Microscopy algorithm and an in-house developed method. Mucins and ASL layer height were studied by RT-qPCR and confocal microscopy. Principal component analysis showed that CF and non-CF hNEC had distinct cilia beating phenotypes, which was mostly explained by differences in cilia beat organization rather than frequency. Exposure to RvE1 (10 nM) and to LXB4 (10 nM) restored a non-CF like cilia beating phenotype. Furthermore, RvE1 increased the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer height and reduced the mucin MUC5AC thickness. The calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16A was involved in RvE1 effect on cilia beating, hydration and mucus. Altogether, our results provide evidence for defective cilia beating in CF airway epithelium and a role of RvE1 and LXB4 to restore the main epithelial functions involved in the mucociliary clearance.",

        "Authors": "Zhi Chen, Zachary Feinstein, Ionut Florescu, Papa Momar Ndiaye",
        "Abstract": "Investors are increasingly incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings into their investment strategies to evaluate and manage potential risks and sustainability of companies. ESG ratings typically follow a hierarchical structure, where raw data points are progressively aggregated, leading to individual E, S, G scores and ultimately aggregating in a broad, consolidated ESG score. While many studies have investigated the relationship between stock performance and individual or overall ESG scores, few have used raw ESG data into their analyses. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the difference in predictive capabilities of ESG raw scores versus aggregated scores on annual company stock returns and volatility. Our findings reveal a trend where the predictive power is strongest at the raw data level, and it gradually weakens through successive stages of aggregation, with the overall scores exhibiting the weakest predictive capability. This result highlights the effectiveness of raw ESG data in capturing the complex dynamics between ESG factors and financial performance, making it the superior choice in further study.",

        "Abstract": "Financial markets are undergoing an unprecedented transformation. Technological advances have brought major improvements to the operations of financial services. While these advances promote improved accessibility and convenience, traditional finance shortcomings like lack of transparency and moral hazard frictions continue to plague centralized platforms, imposing societal costs. In this paper, we argue how these shortcomings and frictions are being mitigated by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We delve into the workings of smart contracts, the backbone of DeFi transactions, with an emphasis on those underpinning token exchange and lending services. We highlight the pros and cons of the novel form of decentralized governance introduced via the ownership of governance tokens. Despite its potential, the current DeFi infrastructure introduces operational risks to users, which we segment into five primary categories: consensus mechanisms, protocol, oracle, frontrunning, and systemic risks. We conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to focus on the scalability of existing blockchains, the improved design and interoperability of DeFi protocols, and the rigorous auditing of smart contracts.",

        "Abstract": "In Gatheral et al. 2018, first posted in 2014, volatility is characterized by fractional behavior with a Hurst exponent $H < 0.5$, challenging traditional views of volatility dynamics. Gatheral et al. demonstrated this using realized volatility measurements. Our study extends this analysis by employing range-based proxies to confirm their findings across a broader dataset and non-standard assets. Notably, we address the concern that rough volatility might be an artifact of microstructure noise in high-frequency return data. Our results reveal that log-volatility, estimated via range-based methods, behaves akin to fractional Brownian motion with an even lower $H$, below $0.1$. We also affirm the efficacy of the rough fractional stochastic volatility model (RFSV), finding that its predictive capability surpasses that of AR, HAR, and GARCH models in most scenarios. This work substantiates the intrinsic nature of rough volatility, independent of the microstructure noise often present in high-frequency financial data.",

        "Abstract": "A backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) is an SDE of the form $-dY_t = f(t,Y_t,Z_t)dt - Z_t^*dW_t;\\ Y_T = Œæ$. The subject of BSDEs has seen extensive attention since their introduction in the linear case by Bismut (1973) and in the general case by Pardoux and Peng (1990). In contrast with deterministic differential equations, it is not enough to simply reverse the direction of time and treat the terminal condition as an initial condition, as we would then run into problems with adaptedness. Intuitively, our \"knowledge\" at time $t$ consists only of what has happened at all times $s \\in [0,t]$, and we cannot reverse the direction of time whilst keeping this true.\n  The layout of this essay is as follows: In Section 1 we introduce BSDEs and go over the basic results of BSDE theory, including two major theorems: the existence and uniqueness of solutions and the comparison theorem. We also introduce linear BSDEs and the notion of supersolutions of a BSDE. In Section 2 we set up the financial framework in which we will price European contingent claims, and prove a result about the fair price of such claims in a dynamically complete market. In Section 3 we extend the theory of linear BSDEs to include concave BSDEs, and apply this to pricing claims in more complicated market models. In Section 4 we take a look at utility maximisation problems, and see how utilising BSDE theory allows for a relatively simple and neat solution in certain cases.",

Discounting future benefits and costs of climate change mitigation is one of the most important components of assessing efficient climate mitigation pathways. We extend the DICE model with stochastic discount rates to reflect the dynamic nature of discount rates. Stochastic rates give rise to a mitigation strategy, resulting in all model quantities becoming stochastic. We show that the classical calibration of the DICE model induces intergenerational inequality: future generations have to bear higher costs relative to GDP and that this effect worsens under stochastic discount rates. Accounting for additional financing risks, we investigate two modifications of DICE. We find that allowing financing of abatement costs and considering non-linear financing effects for large damages improves intergenerational effort sharing. We propose a modified optimisation to keep costs below 3\\% of GDP, resulting in more equal efforts between generations.",

More precisely, we generalize the Half-Full/Half-Empty approach to the context of positive and negative lotteries and give financial and behavioral interpretations of the Half-Full/Half-Empty parameters. We develop a portfolio selection model based on the Half-Full/Half-Empty strategy, resulting in a nonconvex optimization problem, which, nonetheless, is proven to be equivalent to an alternative Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation. By means of the ensuing empirical analysis, based on three real-world datasets, the Half-Full/Half-Empty model is shown to be very versatile by appropriately varying its parameters, and to provide portfolios displaying promising performances in terms of risk and profitability, compared with Prospect Theory, risk minimization approaches and Equally-Weighted portfolios.",

We first show that the maximum diversification approach is actually equivalent to the Risk Parity approach using volatility under the assumption of equicorrelated assets. Then, we extend the maximum diversification approach formulated for general risk measures. Finally, we provide explicit formulations of our bi-objective model for different risk measures, such as volatility, Mean Absolute Deviation, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and Expectiles, and we present extensive out-of-sample performance results for the portfolios obtained with our model. The empirical analysis, based on five real-world data sets, shows that the return-diversification approach provides portfolios that tend to outperform the strategies based only on a diversification method or on the classical risk-return approach.",

        "Abstract": "The primary innovation we pioneer -- focused on blockchain information security -- is called the Safe-House. The Safe-House is badly needed since there are many ongoing hacks and security concerns in the DeFi space right now. The Safe-House is a piece of engineering sophistication that utilizes existing blockchain principles to bring about greater security when customer assets are moved around. The Safe-House logic is easily implemented as smart contracts on any decentralized system. The amount of funds at risk from both internal and external parties -- and hence the maximum one time loss -- is guaranteed to stay within the specified limits based on cryptographic fundamentals.\n  To improve the safety of the Safe-House even further, we adapt the one time password (OPT) concept to operate using blockchain technology. Well suited to blockchain cryptographic nuances, our secondary advancement can be termed the one time next time password (OTNTP) mechanism. The OTNTP is designed to complement the Safe-House making it even more safe.\n  We provide a detailed threat assessment model -- discussing the risks faced by DeFi protocols and the specific risks that apply to blockchain fund management -- and give technical arguments regarding how these threats can be overcome in a robust manner. We discuss how the Safe-House can participate with other external yield generation protocols in a secure way. We provide reasons for why the Safe-House increases safety without sacrificing the efficiency of operation. We start with a high level intuitive description of the landscape, the corresponding problems and our solutions. We then supplement this overview with detailed discussions including the corresponding mathematical formulations and pointers for technological implementation. This approach ensures that the article is accessible to a broad audience.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we study set-valued Volterra-type stochastic integrals driven by L√©vy processes. Upon extending the classical definitions of set-valued stochastic integral functionals to convoluted integrals with square-integrable kernels, set-valued convoluted stochastic integrals are defined by taking the closed decomposable hull of the integral functionals for generic time. We show that, aside from well-established results for set-valued It√¥ integrals, while set-valued stochastic integrals with respect to a finite-variation Poisson random measure are guaranteed to be integrably bounded for bounded integrands, this is not true when the random measure is of infinite variation. For indefinite integrals, we prove that it is a mutual effect of kernel singularity and jumps that the set-valued convoluted integrals are possibly explosive and take extended vector values. These results have some important implications on how set-valued fractional dynamical systems are to be constructed in general. Two classes of set-monotone processes are studied for practical interests in economic and financial modeling.",

        "Abstract": "Observations indicate that the distributions of stock returns in financial markets usually do not conform to normal distributions, but rather exhibit characteristics of high peaks, fat tails and biases. In this work, we assume that the effects of events or information on prices obey normal distribution, while financial markets often overreact or underreact to events or information, resulting in non normal distributions of stock returns. Based on the above assumptions, we propose a reaction function for a financial market reacting to events or information, and a model based on it to describe the distribution of real stock returns. Our analysis of the returns of China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300), the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (SPX or S&P 500) and the Nikkei 225 Index (N225) at different time scales shows that financial markets often underreact to events or information with minor impacts, overreact to events or information with relatively significant impacts, and react slightly stronger to positive events or information than to negative ones. In addition, differences in financial markets and time scales of returns can also affect the shapes of the reaction functions.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing use of stochastic models for describing complex phenomena warrants surrogate models that capture the reference model characteristics at a fraction of the computational cost, foregoing potentially expensive Monte Carlo simulation. The predominant approach of fitting a large neural network and then pruning it to a reduced size has commonly neglected shortcomings. The produced surrogate models often will not capture the sensitivities and uncertainties inherent in the original model. In particular, (higher-order) derivative information of such surrogates could differ drastically. Given a large enough network, we expect this derivative information to match. However, the pruned model will almost certainly not share this behavior.\n  In this paper, we propose to find surrogate models by using sensitivity information throughout the learning and pruning process. We build on work using Interval Adjoint Significance Analysis for pruning and combine it with the recent advancements in Sobolev Training to accurately model the original sensitivity information in the pruned neural network based surrogate model. We experimentally underpin the method on an example of pricing a multidimensional Basket option modelled through a stochastic differential equation with Brownian motion. The proposed method is, however, not limited to the domain of quantitative finance, which was chosen as a case study for intuitive interpretations of the sensitivities. It serves as a foundation for building further surrogate modelling techniques considering sensitivity information.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce Onflow, a reinforcement learning technique that enables online optimization of portfolio allocation policies based on gradient flows. We devise dynamic allocations of an investment portfolio to maximize its expected log return while taking into account transaction fees. The portfolio allocation is parameterized through a softmax function, and at each time step, the gradient flow method leads to an ordinary differential equation whose solutions correspond to the updated allocations. This algorithm belongs to the large class of stochastic optimization procedures; we measure its efficiency by comparing our results to the mathematical theoretical values in a log-normal framework and to standard benchmarks from the 'old NYSE' dataset. For log-normal assets, the strategy learned by Onflow, with transaction costs at zero, mimics Markowitz's optimal portfolio and thus the best possible asset allocation strategy. Numerical experiments from the 'old NYSE' dataset show that Onflow leads to dynamic asset allocation strategies whose performances are: a) comparable to benchmark strategies such as Cover's Universal Portfolio or Helmbold et al. \"multiplicative updates\" approach when transaction costs are zero, and b) better than previous procedures when transaction costs are high. Onflow can even remain efficient in regimes where other dynamical allocation techniques do not work anymore. Therefore, as far as tested, Onflow appears to be a promising dynamic portfolio management strategy based on observed prices only and without any assumption on the laws of distributions of the underlying assets' returns. In particular it could avoid model risk when building a trading strategy.",

        "Authors": "Francesco Cesarone, Manuel Luis Martino, Federica Ricca, Andrea Scozzari",
        "Abstract": "Sustainable Investing identifies the approach of investors whose aim is twofold: on the one hand, they want to achieve the best compromise between portfolio risk and return, but they also want to take into account the sustainability of their investment, assessed through some Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. The inclusion of sustainable goals in the portfolio selection process may have an actual impact on financial portfolio performance. ESG indices provided by the rating agencies are generally considered good proxies for the performance in sustainability of an investment, as well as, appropriate measures for Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) in the market. In this framework of analysis, the lack of alignment between ratings provided by different agencies is a crucial issue that inevitably undermines the robustness and reliability of these evaluation measures. In fact, the ESG rating disagreement may produce conflicting information, implying a difficulty for the investor in the portfolio ESG evaluation. This may cause underestimation or overestimation of the market opportunities for a sustainable investment. In this paper, we deal with a multi-criteria portfolio selection problem taking into account risk, return, and ESG criteria. For the ESG evaluation of the securities in the market, we consider more than one agency and propose a new approach to overcome the problem related to the disagreement between the ESG ratings by different agencies. We propose a nonlinear optimization model for our three-criteria portfolio selection problem.

        "Authors": "Yongzhuo Chen, Yixuan Liang, Yiran Liu, Brian Hobbs, Michael Kane",
        "Abstract": "This research paper addresses the critical challenge of accurately valuing post-revenue drug assets in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, a key factor influencing a wide range of strategic operations and investment decisions. Recognizing the importance of reliable valuations for stakeholders such as pharmaceutical companies, venture capitalists, and private equity firms, this study introduces a novel model for forecasting future sales of post-revenue biopharmaceutical assets. The proposed model leverages historical sales data, a resource known for its high quality and availability in company financial records, to produce distributional estimates of cumulative sales for individual assets. These estimates are instrumental in calculating the Net Present Value of each asset, thereby facilitating more informed and strategic investment decisions. A practical application of this model is demonstrated through its implementation in analyzing Pfizer's portfolio of post-revenue assets. This precision highlights the model's potential as a valuable tool in the financial assessment and decision-making processes within the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, offering a methodical approach to identifying investment opportunities and optimizing capital allocation.",

A key aspect of our study involves the agent's option to choose when to acquire life insurance for bequest purposes. We examine two scenarios: one with a fixed bequest amount and another with a controlled bequest amount. Applying duality theory and addressing free-boundary problems, we analytically solve both cases, and provide explicit expressions for value functions and optimal strategies in both cases. In the first scenario, where the bequest amount is fixed, distinct outcomes emerge based on different levels of risk aversion parameter $Œ≥$: (i) the optimal time for life insurance purchase occurs when the agent's wealth surpasses a critical threshold if $Œ≥\\in (0,1)$, or (ii) life insurance should be acquired immediately if $Œ≥>1$. In contrast, in the second scenario with a controlled bequest amount, regardless of $Œ≥$ values, immediate life insurance purchase proves to be optimal.",

        "Abstract": "This paper explores the utility of agent-based simulations in realistically modelling market structures and sheds light on the nuances of optimal dealer strategies. It underscores the contrast between conclusions drawn from probabilistic modelling and agent-based simulations, but also highlights the importance of employing a realistic test bed to analyse intricate dynamics. This is achieved by extending the agent-based model for auction markets by \\cite{Chiarella.2008} to include liquidity providers. By constantly and passively quoting, the dealers influence their own wealth but also have ramifications on the market as a whole and the other participating agents. Through synthetic market simulations, the optimal behaviour of different dealer strategies and their consequences on market dynamics are examined. The analysis reveals that dealers exhibiting greater risk aversion tend to yield better performance outcomes. The choice of quote sizes by dealers is strategy-dependent: one strategy demonstrates enhanced performance with larger quote sizes, whereas the other strategy show a better results with smaller ones. Increasing quote size shows positive influence on the market in terms of volatility and kurtosis with both dealer strategies. However, the impact stemming from larger risk aversion is mixed. While one of the dealer strategies shows no discernible effect, the other strategy results in mixed outcomes, encompassing both positive and negative effects.",

        "Authors": "Yu-Jui Huang, Li-Hsien Sun",
        "Abstract": "This paper considers finitely many investors who perform mean-variance portfolio selection under a relative performance criterion. That is, each investor is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it compares to the average terminal wealth of all investors (i.e., the mean field). At the inter-personal level, each investor selects a trading strategy in response to others' strategies (which affect the mean field). The selected strategy additionally needs to yield an equilibrium intra-personally, so as to resolve time inconsistency among the investor's current and future selves (triggered by the mean-variance objective). A Nash equilibrium we look for is thus a tuple of trading strategies under which every investor achieves her intra-personal equilibrium simultaneously. We derive such a Nash equilibrium explicitly in the idealized case of full information (i.e., the dynamics of the underlying stock is perfectly known), and semi-explicitly in the realistic case of partial information (i.e., the stock evolution is observed, but the expected return of the stock is not precisely known). The formula under partial information involves an additional state process that serves to filter the true state of the expected return. Its effect on trading is captured by two degenerate Cauchy problems, one of which depends on the other, whose solutions are constructed by elliptic regularization and a stability analysis of the state process. Our results indicate that partial information alone can reduce investors' wealth significantly, thereby causing or aggravating systemic risk. Intriguingly, in two different scenarios of the expected return (i.e., it is constant or alternating between two values), our Nash equilibrium formula spells out two distinct manners systemic risk materializes.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we explore the use of a deep residual U-net with self-attention to solve the the continuous time time-consistent mean variance optimal trade execution problem for multiple agents and assets. Given a finite horizon we formulate the time-consistent mean-variance optimal trade execution problem following the Almgren-Chriss model as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB formulation is known to have a viscosity solution to the unknown value function. We reformulate the HJB to a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) to extend the problem to multiple agents and assets. We utilize a residual U-net with self-attention to numerically approximate the value function for multiple agents and assets which can be used to determine the time-consistent optimal control. In this paper, we show that the proposed neural network approach overcomes the limitations of finite difference methods. We validate our results and study parameter sensitivity. With our framework we study how an agent with significant price impact interacts with an agent without any price impact and the optimal strategies used by both types of agents. We also study the performance of multiple sellers and buyers and how they compare to a holding strategy under different economic conditions.",

        "Authors": "Alexander M. G. Cox, Annemarie M. Grass",
        "Abstract": "The robust option pricing problem is to find upper and lower bounds on fair prices of financial claims using only the most minimal assumptions. It contrasts with the classical, model-based approach and gained prominence in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and can be used to understand the extent to which a model-based price is sensitive to the underlying model assumptions. Common approaches involve pricing exotic derivatives such as variance options by incorporating market data through implied volatility. The existing literature focuses largely on incorporating implied volatility information corresponding to the maturity of the exotic option. In this paper, we aim to explain how intermediate data can and should be incorporated. It is natural to expect that this additional information will improve the robust pricing bounds. To investigate this question, we consider variance options, where the bounds of the informed robust pricing problem are known. We proceed to conduct an empirical study uncovering a surprising finding: Contrary to common belief, the incorporation of more information does not lead to an improvement of the robust pricing bounds.",

After suitable rescaling the price-volatility process converges weakly to a rough Heston model. Our convergence result is much stronger than previously established ones that have either focused on light-tailed kernels or the convergence of integrated volatility process. The key is to establish the tightness of the family of rescaled volatility processes. This is achieved by introducing a new methods to establish the $C$-tightness of c√†dl√†g processes based on the classical Kolmogorov-Chentsov tightness criterion for continuous processes.",

        "Abstract": "Portfolio optimization methods have evolved significantly since Markowitz introduced the mean-variance framework in 1952. While the theoretical appeal of this approach is undeniable, its practical implementation poses important challenges, primarily revolving around the intricate task of estimating expected returns. As a result, practitioners and scholars have explored alternative methods that prioritize risk management and diversification. One such approach is Risk Budgeting, where portfolio risk is allocated among assets according to predefined risk budgets. The effectiveness of Risk Budgeting in achieving true diversification can, however, be questioned, given that asset returns are often influenced by a small number of risk factors. From this perspective, one question arises: is it possible to allocate risk at the factor level using the Risk Budgeting approach? This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to address this question by introducing risk measures directly associated with risk factor exposures and demonstrating the desirable mathematical properties of these risk measures, making them suitable for optimization. We also propose a framework to find the portfolio that effectively balances the risk contributions from both assets and factors. Leveraging standard stochastic algorithms, our framework enables the use of a wide range of risk measures.",

        "Abstract": "Mean-deviation models, along with the existing theory of coherent risk measures, are well studied in the literature. In this paper, we characterize monotonic mean-deviation (risk) measures from a general mean-deviation model by applying a risk-weighting function to the deviation part. The form is a combination of the deviation-related functional and the expectation, and such measures belong to the class of consistent risk measures. The monotonic mean-deviation measures admit an axiomatic foundation via preference relations. By further assuming the convexity and linearity of the risk-weighting function, the characterizations for convex and coherent risk measures are obtained, giving rise to many new explicit examples of convex and nonconvex consistent risk measures. Further, we specialize in the convex case of the monotonic mean-deviation measure and obtain its dual representation. The worst-case values of the monotonic mean-deviation measures are analyzed under two popular settings of model uncertainty. Finally, we establish asymptotic consistency and normality of the natural estimators of the monotonic mean-deviation measures.",

        "Abstract": "We study zero-sum stochastic games between a singular controller and a stopper when the (state-dependent) diffusion matrix of the underlying controlled diffusion process is degenerate. In particular, we show the existence of a value for the game and determine an optimal strategy for the stopper. The degeneracy of the dynamics prevents the use of analytical methods based on solution in Sobolev spaces of suitable variational problems. Therefore we adopt a probabilistic approach based on a perturbation of the underlying diffusion modulated by a parameter $Œ≥>0$. For each $Œ≥>0$ the approximating game is non-degenerate and admits a value $u^Œ≥$ and an optimal strategy $œÑ^Œ≥_*$ for the stopper. Letting $Œ≥\\to 0$ we prove convergence of $u^Œ≥$ to a function $v$, which identifies the value of the original game. We also construct explicitly optimal stopping times $Œ∏^Œ≥_*$ for $u^Œ≥$, related but not equal to $œÑ^Œ≥_*$, which converge almost surely to an optimal stopping time $Œ∏_*$ for the game with degenerate dynamics.",

As for the deviation measure, our focus is on convex signed Choquet integrals (such as the Gini coefficient and a convex distortion risk measure minus the expected value) and on the standard deviation. We find that if the expected value premium principle is used, then stop-loss indemnities are optimal, and we provide a precise characterization of the corresponding deductible. Moreover, if the premium principle is based on Value-at-Risk or Expected Shortfall, then a particular layer-type indemnity is optimal, in which there is coverage for small losses up to a limit, and additionally for losses beyond another deductible. The structure of these optimal indemnities remains unchanged if there is a limit on the insurance premium budget. If the unconstrained solution is not feasible, then the deductible is increased to make the budget constraint binding.

The insider aims to exploit her informational advantage and maximise expected profits while the market maker observes the total order flow and sets prices accordingly.\n  First, we show how the multi-period model with finitely many pure strategies can be reduced to a (static) social system in the sense of Debreu (1952) and prove the existence of a sequential Kyle equilibrium, following Kreps and Wilson (1982). This requires no probabilistic restrictions on the true value, the insider's dynamic information, and the noise trader's actions.\n  In the single-period model we establish bounds for the insider's strategy in equilibrium. Finally, we prove the existence of an equilibrium for the game with a continuum of actions, by considering an approximating sequence of games with finitely many actions. Because of the lack of compactness of the set of measurable price functions, standard infinite-dimensional fixed point theorems are not applicable.",

To accommodate a wide array of investment strategies, we further investigate portfolio blending and propose a general framework for evaluating and combining investment strategies. We employ an extension of the multi-armed bandit framework and use value models and policy models to construct eclectic blended portfolios based on past performance. We consider similarity and optimality measures for value models and employ probability-matching (\"blending\") and a greedy algorithm (\"switching\") for policy models. The eclectic portfolios are also evaluated using LASSO models. We show that the value model utilizing cosine similarity and logit optimality consistently delivers robust superior performances.

        "Abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to develop a martingale-type solution to optimal consumption--investment choice problems ([Merton, 1969] and [Merton, 1971]) under time-varying incomplete preferences driven by externalities such as patience, socialization effects, and market volatility. The market is composed of multiple risky assets and multiple consumption goods, while in addition there are multiple fluctuating preference parameters with inexact values connected to imprecise tastes. Utility maximization is a multi-criteria problem with possibly function-valued criteria. To come up with a complete characterization of the solutions, first we motivate and introduce a set-valued stochastic process for the dynamics of multi-utility indices and formulate the optimization problem in a topological vector space. Then, we modify a classical scalarization method allowing for infiniteness and randomness in dimensions and prove results of equivalence to the original problem. Illustrative examples are given to demonstrate practical interests and method applicability progressively. The link between the original problem and a dual problem is also discussed, relatively briefly. Finally, using Malliavin calculus with stochastic geometry, we find optimal investment policies to be generally set-valued, each of whose selectors admits a four-way decomposition involving an additional indecisiveness risk-hedging portfolio. Our results touch on new directions for optimal consumption--investment choices in the presence of incomparability and time inconsistency, also signaling potentially testable assumptions on the variability of asset prices. Simulation techniques for set-valued processes are studied for how solved optimal policies can be computed in practice.",

We explain and demonstrate with numerical examples that accurate and fast calculations of prices of double barrier options in jump models are extremely difficult using the numerical methods available in the literature. We develop a new efficient method (GWR-SINH method) based of the Gaver-Wynn-Rho acceleration applied to the Bromwich integral; the SINH-acceleration and simplified trapezoid rule are used to evaluate perpetual double barrier options for each value of the spectral parameter in GWR-algorithm. The program in Matlab running on a Mac with moderate characteristics achieves the precision of the order of E-5 and better in several several dozen of milliseconds; the precision E-07 is achievable in about 0.1 sec. We outline the extension of GWR-SINH method to regime-switching models and models with stochastic parameters and stochastic interest rates.",

More precisely, the paper focusses on a strategic dynamic game in which two financially-constrained firms operate in the same market. The firms distribute dividends and are faced with default risk. The strategic interaction arises from the fact that if one firm defaults, the other one becomes a monopolist and increases its profitability.\n  To determine a Nash equilibrium in feedback form, we develop two different concepts depending on the initial endowment of each firm. If one firm is richer than the other one, then we use a notion of control vs.\\ strategy equilibrium. If the two firms have the same initial endowment (hence they are symmetric in our setup) then we need mixed strategies in order to construct a symmetric equilibrium.",

        "Abstract": "The assessment of risk based on historical data faces many challenges, in particular due to the limited amount of available data, lack of stationarity, and heavy tails. While estimation on a short-term horizon for less extreme percentiles tends to be reasonably accurate, extending it to longer time horizons or extreme percentiles poses significant difficulties. The application of theoretical risk scaling laws to address this issue has been extensively explored in the literature.\n  This paper presents a novel approach to scaling a given risk estimator, ensuring that the estimated capital reserve is robust and conservatively estimates the risk. We develop a simple statistical framework that allows efficient risk scaling and has a direct link to backtesting performance. Our method allows time scaling beyond the conventional square-root-of-time rule, enables risk transfers, such as those involved in economic capital allocation, and could be used for unbiased risk estimation in small sample settings.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide various examples related to the estimation of value-at-risk and expected shortfall together with a short empirical study analysing the impact of our method.",

        "Abstract": "For L√©vy processes with exponentially decaying tails of the L√©vy density, we derive integral representations for the joint cpdf $V$ of $(X_T, \\bar X_T,œÑ_T)$ (the process, its supremum evaluated at $T<+\\infty$, and the first time at which $X$ attains its supremum). The first representation is a Riemann-Stieltjes integral in terms of the (cumulative) probability distribution of the supremum process and joint probability distribution function of the process and its supremum process. The integral is evaluated using a combination an analog of the trapezoid rule. The second representation is amenable to more accurate albeit slower calculations. We calculate explicitly the Laplace-Fourier transform of $V$ w.r.t. all arguments, apply the inverse transforms, and reduce the problem to evaluation of the sum of 5D integrals. The integrals can be evaluated using the summation by parts in the infinite trapezoid rule and simplified trapezoid rule; the inverse Laplace transforms can be calculated using the Gaver-Wynn-Rho algorithm. Under additional conditions on the domain of analyticity of the characteristic exponent, the speed of calculations is greatly increased using the conformal deformation technique. For processes of infinite variation, the program in Matlab running on a Mac with moderate characteristics achieves the precision better than E-05 in a fraction of a second; the precision better than E-10 is achievable in dozens of seconds. As the order of the process (the analog of the Blumenthal-Getoor index) decreases, the CPU time increases, and the best accuracy achievable with double precision arithmetic decreases.",

The ME is obtained by developing a general Markovian embedding using a suitable set of auxiliary field variables. This Markovian embedding uses a Laplace-convolution operation applied to the velocity trajectory. We introduce an asymptotic method tailored for this ME standard, generalising the system-size expansion for these jump processes. Under specific stability conditions tied to a single noise source, upon coarse-graining, the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) emerges as a universal approximate model for point processes in the weak-coupling limit. This methodology offers a unified analytical toolset for general non-Markovian processes, reinforcing the universal applicability of the GLE founded in microdynamics and the principles of statistical physics.",

PULSE outperforms standard machine learning and statistical methods when predicting if a trade will be toxic; the benchmark methods are logistic regression, random forests, and a recursively-updated maximum-likelihood estimator. We devise a strategy for the broker who uses toxicity predictions to internalise or to externalise each trade received from her clients. Our methodology can be implemented in real-time because it takes less than one millisecond to update parameters and make a prediction. Compared with the benchmarks, PULSE attains the highest PnL and the largest avoided loss for the horizons we consider.",

        "Abstract": "Consumer credit services offered by e-commerce platforms provide customers with convenient loan access during shopping and have the potential to stimulate sales. To understand the causal impact of credit lines on spending, previous studies have employed causal estimators, based on direct regression (DR), inverse propensity weighting (IPW), and double machine learning (DML) to estimate the treatment effect. However, these estimators do not consider the notion that an individual's spending can be understood and represented as a distribution, which captures the range and pattern of amounts spent across different orders. By disregarding the outcome as a distribution, valuable insights embedded within the outcome distribution might be overlooked. This paper develops a distribution-valued estimator framework that extends existing real-valued DR-, IPW-, and DML-based estimators to distribution-valued estimators within Rubin's causal framework. We establish their consistency and apply them to a real dataset from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings reveal that credit lines positively influence spending across all quantiles; however, as credit lines increase, consumers allocate more to luxuries (higher quantiles) than necessities (lower quantiles).",

The optimal value function of the resulting two-dimensional stochastic control problem is shown to be the smallest viscosity supersolution of a corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and we prove that it can be uniformly approximated through a discretization of the space of the free surplus of the portfolio and the current claim intensity level. We implement the resulting numerical scheme to identify optimal dividend strategies for such a natural catastrophe insurer, and it is shown that the nature of the barrier and band strategies known from the classical models with constant Poisson claim intensity carry over in a certain way to this more general situation, leading to action and non-action regions for the dividend payments as a function of the current surplus and intensity level. We also discuss some interpretations in terms of upward potential for shareholders when including a catastrophe sector in the portfolio.",

The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_Œ≤\\times \\mathbb{R}$, where $Œ≤$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_Œ≤$ is the one-dimensional sphere (circle).

We particularly show that the presence of edge modes is not justified by gauge invariance of the presymplectic form, but rather by the condition that the presymplectic form is degenerate on the initial field space, which allows to relate this presymplectic form to the symplectic form on the gauge reduced field space via pullback.",

        "Abstract": "Impulsive gravitational waves are theoretical models of short but violent bursts of gravitational radiation. They are commonly described by two distinct spacetime metrics, one of local Lipschitz regularity, the other one even distributional. These two metrics are thought to be `physically equivalent' since they can be formally related by a `discontinuous coordinate transformation'. In this paper we provide a mathematical analysis of this issue for the entire class of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in a background spacetime of constant curvature. We devise a natural geometric regularisation procedure to show that the notorious change of variables arises as the distributional limit of a family of smooth coordinate transformations. In other words, we establish that both spacetimes arise as distributional limits of a smooth sandwich wave taken in different coordinate systems which are diffeomorphically related.",

These signatures are typically analyzed via the 2-point correlation function or power spectrum. However, adding the information from the 3-point correlation function or bispectrum will be crucial to exploiting next-generation intensity mapping experiments. The bispectrum could offer a unique opportunity to break key parameter degeneracies that hinder the measurement of cosmological parameters and improve on the precision. We use a Fisher forecast analysis to estimate the constraining power of the HIRAX survey on cosmological parameters, dark energy and modified gravity.",

In particular, despite \"wrong\" signs in the DBI action for the two-time de Sitter case, the theories have the same S-matrix. This is consistent with the expectation that effective field theories are determined solely by their degrees of freedom and pattern of symmetry breaking, even in the case of spacetime symmetries.

        "Abstract": "Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity allows for the reformulation of gravity in the form of nonmetricity by vanishing the contorsion term in the generic affine connection. Our focus is on investigating a recently proposed extension of this theory in which the Lagrangian has the form $f(Q,C)$ by incorporating the boundary term $C$. In this work, we first use a reconstruction approach in $f(Q,C)$ gravity that might admit the $Œõ$CDM expansion history. Furthermore, we perform a novel approach for cosmological reconstruction of $f(Q,C)$ gravity in terms of e-folding, and it shows how any FLRW cosmology can arise from a specific $f(Q,C)$ gravity. A variety of instances are provided using this approach in which $f(Q, C)$ gravity is reconstructed to yield the well-known cosmic evolution: $Œõ$CDM era, acceleration/deceleration era which is equivalent to the presence of phantom and non-phantom matter, late-time acceleration with the crossing of phantom-divide line and transient phantom era.",

        "Authors": "Cynthia Trendafilova, Selim C. Hotinli, Joel Meyers",
        "Abstract": "The delensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps will be increasingly valuable for extracting as much information as possible from future CMB surveys. Delensing provides many general benefits, including sharpening of the acoustic peaks, more accurate recovery of the damping tail, and reduction of lensing-induced $B$-mode power. In this paper we present several applications of delensing focused on testing theories of early-universe inflation with observations of the CMB. We find that delensing the CMB results in improved parameter constraints for reconstructing the spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations, probing oscillatory features in the primordial curvature spectrum, measuring the spatial curvature of the universe, and constraining several different models of isocurvature perturbations. In some cases we find that delensing can recover almost all of the constraining power contained in unlensed spectra, and it will be a particularly valuable analysis technique to achieve further improvements in constraints for model parameters whose measurements are not expected to improve significantly when utilizing only lensed CMB maps from next-generation CMB surveys. We also quantify the prospects of testing the single-field inflation tensor consistency condition using delensed CMB data; we find it to be out of reach of current and proposed experimental technology and advocate for alternative detection methods.",

        "Abstract": "This thesis aims at improving our understanding of the strong-field regime of gravity, where deviations from General Relativity (GR) are expected to be found on theoretical grounds. In particular, we have been concerned with the formulation and application of junction conditions (which govern stellar collapse, black-hole formation and the dynamics of more exotic compact objects, such as thin-shell wormholes), as well as with other viability criteria necessary for modified gravity theories and their solutions to be physically admissible (for instance, compatibility with gravitational-wave observations, stability or the avoidance singularities).\n  First, we have studied stellar collapse in $f(R)$ gravity. By means of a systematic treatment of the relevant junction conditions, we have proven a series of stringent no-go results on the exterior space-time, which entail that some paradigmatic classes of vacuum metrics cannot represent space-time outside a collapsing dust star in metric $f(R)$ gravity. This could lead to potentially observable deviations with respect to GR.\n  We have also provided an exhaustive derivation of the junction conditions in bi-scalar Poincar√© gauge gravity, finding that the matching interface is allowed to host surface axial spin monopoles, as well as matter thin shells and double layers. This singular structure is richer than its counterparts in GR or $f(R)$ gravity, leading to possible interesting applications. In addition, we have had to resolve some procedural and mathematical subtleties in the junction-condition formalism.\n  Finally, we have examined a wide class of metric $f(R)$ models, the so-called '$R_0$-degenerate models,' solved by all metrics with constant scalar curvature $R=R_0$. We have shown that they feature all sorts of shortcomings (such as previously-unforeseen strong-coupling instabilities) rendering their viability extremely limited.",

        "Abstract": "We explore a new action formulation of hyperfluids, fluids with intrinsic hypermomentum. Brown's Lagrangian for a relativistic perfect fluid is generalised by incorporating the degrees of freedom encoded in the hypermomentum tensor, namely by including connection-matter couplings. Quite interestingly, generic hyperfluids are imperfect, since hypermomentum induces such effects as bulk and shear viscosities as well as heat fluxes. The various coefficients that appear in the first order expansion of hydrodynamics can now be deduced from a Lagrangian formulation, given a geometrical interpretation and a suggested microscopic description in terms of hypermomentum. This connection between hypermomentum and dissipative fluids could shed new light on the physics of relativistic hydrodynamics. The applicability of the new formalism is demonstrated by exact cosmological solutions.",

        "Authors": "Gabriela Sato-Polito, Matias Zaldarriaga, Eliot Quataert",
        "Abstract": "Multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported the first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of nanohertz frequencies. The signal is expected to be primarily sourced by inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) and these first results are broadly consistent with the expected GW spectrum from such a population. Curiously, the measured amplitude of the GW background in all announced results is a bit larger than theoretical predictions. In this work, we show that the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) predicted from the present-day abundance of SMBHs derived from local scaling relations is significantly smaller than that measured by the PTAs. We demonstrate that this difference cannot be accounted for through changes in the merger history of SMBHs and that there is an upper limit to the boost to the characteristic strain from multiple merger events, due to the fact that they involve black holes of decreasing masses. If we require the current estimate of the black hole mass density -- equal to the integrated quasar luminosity function through the classic Soltan argument -- to be preserved, then the currently measured PTA result would imply that the typical total mass of SMBHs contributing to the background should be at least $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$, a factor of $\\sim 10$ larger than previously predicted. The required space density of such massive black holes corresponds to order $10$ $3 \\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$ SMBHs within the volume accessible by stellar and gas dynamical SMBH measurements. By virtue of the GW signal being dominated by the massive end of the SMBH distribution, PTA measurements offer a unique window into such rare objects and complement existing electromagnetic observations.",

        "Abstract": "This paper explores the dark energy phenomenon within the context of $f(R,L_m)$ gravity theory. Two specific non-linear $f (R, L_m)$ models are considered: $f(R,L_m)=\\frac{R}{2}+L_m^Œ±$ and $f(R,L_m)=\\frac{R}{2}+(1+Œ±R)L_m$, where the parameter $Œ±$ is free. Here, we adopt a parametrization form for the Hubble parameter in terms of redshift $z$ as $H(z)=H_0 \\left[A(1+z)^3+B+Œµ\\log(1+z)\\right]^\\frac{1}{2}$, which allows for deviations from the standard $Œõ$CDM model at both low and high redshifts. We then incorporate the Hubble parameter solution into the Friedmann equations for both models. We employ Bayesian analysis to estimate the constraints on the free parameters $H_0$, $A$, $B$, and $Œµ$ using the Hubble measurements and the Pantheon dataset. Further, we investigate the evolution of key cosmological quantities, such as the deceleration parameter, energy density, pressure, EoS parameter, and energy conditions. The evolution of the deceleration parameter reveals a significant transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating phase in the Universe. The EoS parameter exhibits quintessence-like behavior for both non-linear $f (R, L_m)$ models.",

The former connection arises from the exponentiation of spin operators, while the latter from a duality operation. In this paper, we mainly investigate how the connections manifest in the dynamics of black holes. Specifically, we focus on studying the correlations of quasinormal frequencies among Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Taub-NUT black holes.

        "Abstract": "It is known that the appearance of microscopic objects with distinct topology and different Euler characteristics, such as instatons and wormholes, at the spacetime-foam level in Euclidean quantum gravity approaches, leads to spacetime topology changes. Such changes, in principle, may affect the field equations that arise through the semiclassical variation procedure of gravitational actions. Although in the case of Einstein-Hilbert action the presence of microscopic wormholes does not lead to any non-trivial result, when the Gauss-Bonnet term is added in the gravitational action, the above effective topological variation procedure induces an effective cosmological term that depends on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the wormhole density. Since the later in a dynamical spacetime is in general time-dependent, one obtains an effective dark energy sector of topological origin.",

They encompass the semiclassical space-time behaviour plus high quantum phase oscillations, and notably account for the classical-quantum gravity duality and trans-Planckian domain. The Planck scale consistently corresponds to the coherent state eigenvalue $Œ±= 0$ (and to the $n = 0$ level in the discrete representation). It is remarkable the power of coherent states in describing both continuum and discrete space-time.

Indeed, as gravitational waves from the coalescence of a massive black hole binary (MBHB) carry direct information of the luminosity distances, an accompanying electromagnetic (EM) counterpart can be used to determine the redshift. This method of $bright$ $sirens$ enables one to build a gravitational Hubble diagram to high redshift when applied to LISA. In this work, we forecast the ability of LISA-detected MBHB bright sirens to constrain cosmological models. As the expected EM emission from MBHBs can be detected up to redshift $z\\sim 7$ with future astronomical facilities, we focus on the ability of LISA to constrain the expansion of the Universe at $z\\sim 2-3$, a poorly charted epoch in cosmography. We find that a model-independent approach to cosmology based on a spline interpolation of the luminosity distance-redshift relation, can constrain the Hubble parameter at $z\\sim2-3$ with a relative precision of at least $10\\%$.",

Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n<1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n<1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n<1$ Renyi entropies.",

        "Abstract": "Extreme scattering events (ESEs) are observed as dramatic ($>50\\%$) drops in flux density that occur over an extended period of weeks to months. Discrete plasma lensing structures are theorized to scatter the radio waves produced by distant sources such as pulsars, causing the signature decrease in flux density and characteristic caustic spikes in ESE light curves. While plasma lens models in the extant literature have reproduced key features of ESE light curves, they have all faced the problem of being highly over-dense and over-pressured relative to the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) by orders of magnitude. We model ESEs by numerically ray-tracing through analytic, volumetric plasma lens models by solving the eikonal equation. Delaunay triangulation connecting the rays approximates the wavefront, generating a mapping from the observer plane to the source plane to account for multiple-imaging. This eikonal method of ray-tracing is tested against known analytic solutions and is then applied to a three-dimensional Gaussian-distributed electron volume density lens, and a filament model inspired by Grafton et al. (2023). We find convergence of our numerical results with established analytic solutions validating our numerical method, and reproduce ESE-like light curves. Our numerical ray-tracing method lends itself well to exploring the lensing effects of volumetric turbulence as well as sheet-like lenses, which is currently in progress.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advancements in gravitational wave astronomy have seen the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in signal detection from compact binary coalescences. This study presents a comparative analysis of two CNN architectures: one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) along with an ensemble model combining both. We trained these models to detect gravitational wave signals from binary black hole (BBH) mergers, neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers within real detector noise. Our investigation entailed a comprehensive evaluation of the detection performance of each model type across different signal classes. To understand the models' decision-making processes, we employed feature map visualization and attribution analysis. The findings revealed that while the 1D model showed superior performance in detecting BBH signals, the 2D model excelled in identifying NSBH and BNS signals. Notably, the ensemble model outperformed both individual models across all signal types, demonstrating enhanced detection capabilities. Additionally, input feature visualization indicated distinct areas of focus in the data for the 1D and 2D models, emphasizing the effectiveness of their combination.",

        "Authors": "Alexander M. Grant, Keefe Mitman",
        "Abstract": "Gravitational memory effects are predictions of general relativity that are characterized by an observable effect that persists after the passage of gravitational waves. In recent years, they have garnered particular interest, both due to their connection to asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems and because their observation would serve as a unique test of the nonlinear nature of general relativity. Apart from the more commonly known displacement and spin memories, however, there are other memory effects predicted by Einstein's equations that are associated with more subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the Bondi-Sachs metric. In this paper, we write explicit expressions for these higher memory effects in terms of their charge and flux contributions. Further, by using a numerical relativity simulation of a binary black hole merger, we compute the magnitude and morphology of these terms and compare them to those of the displacement and spin memory. We find that, although these terms are interesting from a theoretical perspective, due to their small magnitude they will be particularly challenging to observe with current and future detectors.",

Hence, there has been a growing interest in exploring phenomenological scenarios that describe singularity-free black holes, gravitational collapses, and cosmological models. We examine the metric put forth by Mazza, Franzin \\& Liberati for a rotating regular black hole and estimate the regularization parameter $l$ based on existing X-ray and gravitational wave data for black holes. When $l=0$, the solution corresponds to the singular Kerr solution of general relativity, while a non-zero value of $l$ yields a regular black hole or a regular wormhole. The analysis reveals that the available data support a value of $l$ that is close to zero.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, certain holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ is proposed to capture the main features of the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ correspondence \\cite{Basu:2022crn,Basu:2023wmv}. In this paper, by adapting the Weyl transformation, we simulate a generalized AdS/BCFT set-up where the fluctuation of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane is considered. In the gravity dual of the Weyl transformed CFT, the so-called cutoff brane induced by the Weyl transformation plays the same role as the KR brane. Unlike the non-fluctuating configuration, in the $2d$ effective theory the additional twist operator is inserted at a different places, compared with the one inserted on the brane. Though this is well-understood in the Weyl transformed CFT set-up, it is confusing in the AdS/BCFT set-up where the effective theory is supposed to locate on the brane. This confusion indicates that the KR brane may be emergent from the boundary CFT$_2$ via the Weyl transformations.\n  We also calculate the balanced partial entanglement (BPE) in the fluctuating brane configurations and find it coincide with the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS). This is a non-trivial test for the correspondence between the BPE and the EWCS, and a non-trivial consistency check for the Weyl transformed CFT set-up.",

In this letter, we solve the first two puzzles by presenting covariant formulas that unambiguously determine the auxiliary degrees of freedom and clarify the last puzzle by explaining the different role played by covariant and canonical charges. Our construction makes explicit the choice of reference frame underpinning seemingly unambiguous results presented in the current literature.",

        "Abstract": "Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar mass weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the \\textsc{UniverseMachine} simulations with this delay time model to infer the probable host galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host galaxy distribution at redshift $z=0.21$ has a median star formation rate $\\sim 0.9\\,M_\\odot\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and a median stellar mass of $\\sim 1.9 \\times 10^{10}\\,M_\\odot$. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large scale bias associated with the host galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B- and ${ \\rm K_s}$-bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark siren method.",

        "Abstract": "It is commonly believed that black holes are the smallest self-gravitating objects of the same mass in the Universe. Here, we demonstrate, in a subclass of higher-order pure gravities known as quasi-topological gravity, that by modifying general relativity (GR) to reduce the strength of gravity in strong-field regimes while keeping GR unchanged in weak-field regimes, it is possible for stars to collapse to radii less than $2M$ while still maintaining equilibrium between gravity and pressure gradients, leading to physically-reasonable neutron stars smaller in size than a black hole of the same mass. We present concrete solutions for such objects and discuss some of their observational consequences. These objects may furnish new avenues for understanding the nature of gravity in strong-field regimes and leave imprints on gravitational wave echoes from compact binary mergers. An observation of these imprints may constitute evidence for new physics beyond GR when effects of gravity in strong-field regimes are concerned.",

        "Abstract": "The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group U(1)$_{\\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark-matter candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out these dark-matter models.",

        "Abstract": "During a binary black hole merger, multiple intermediary marginally outer trapped tubes connect the initial pair of apparent horizons with the final (single) apparent horizon. The marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) that foliate these tubes can have complicated geometries as well as non-spherical topologies. In particular, toroidal MOTSs form inside both of the original black holes during the early stages of a head-on merger that starts from time-symmetric initial data [1]. We show that toroidal MOTSs also form in the maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime as Kruskal time advances from the $T=0$ moment of time symmetry. As for the merger simulations, they cross the Einstein-Rosen bridge and are tightly sandwiched between the apparent horizons in the two asymptotic regions at early times. This strongly suggests that their formation is a consequence of the initial conditions rather than merger physics. Finally, we consider MOTSs of spherical topology in the Kruskal-Szekeres slicing and study their properties. All of these are contained within the apparent horizon but some do not enclose the wormhole.",

The difference between different models is sometimes the choice of the scalar field potential $V$. In the literature we find that people usually work in the nonrelativistic, weak-field limit of the KG equation where it transforms into the Schr√∂dinger equation and the Einstein equations into the Poisson equation, reducing the KG-Einstein system, to the Schr√∂dinger-Poisson system. In this paper, we review some of the most interesting achievements of this model from the historical point of view and its comparison with observations, showing that this model could be the last answer to the question about the nature of dark matter in the universe.",

We obtain an analytic formula for the quadratic action of NLMG and show that its linearized spectrum consists of an infinite tower of positive-energy massive spin-2 modes.

We extract and compare gravitational waveforms using the three different mesh refinement methods and compare their accuracy against a calibration waveform and demonstrate that the sphere-in-sphere approach provides the best strategy overall when considering computational cost and the waveform accuracy. Ultimately, we demonstrate the capability of each mesh refinement method in accurately simulating gravitational waves from binary black hole systems -- a crucial aspect for their application in next-generation detectors.

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we study solutions of a static spherically symmetric system, which is composed of the coupling with the Bardeen action and two Dirac fields. For the case where only the Bardeen action is present, the magnetic charge $q$ can be infinite, then when the magnetic charge is greater than a certain value $q_b$, there exists a black hole solution, which is called the Bardeen black hole (BBH). However, if the Dirac field is introduced, we find that the magnetic charge can only be smaller than the critical value $q_b$, in which there is no black hole solution. Moreover, in the region $q<q_b$, we find that if the magnetic charge exceeds another critical value $q_c$ (i.e., $q_c<q<q_b$), the frequency of the Dirac field can approach zero, and the solution where a critical horizon appears is similar to an extremal black hole outside the critical horizon but has a nonsingular interior. The Dirac fields are also almost concentrated within it. In fact, this is a frozen star solution, we call such solutions frozen Bardeen-Dirac stars (FBDSs). We analyze the light rings of FBDSs and find that there exists a ``true\" light ring outside the critical horizon, but inside it, the velocity of photons is very close to zero, which leads to the formation of a ``light ball\" inside the critical horizon.",

        "Abstract": "We analyze time-dependent dark energy equations of state through linear and nonlinear structure formation and their quintessence potentials, characterized by fast, recent transitions, inspired by parameter space studies of Horndeski models. The influence of dark energy on structures comes from modifications to the background expansion rate and from perturbations as well. In order to compute the structures growth, we employ a generalization of the \\emph{spherical collapse} formalism that includes perturbations of fluids with pressure. We numerically solve the equations of motion for the perturbations and the field. Our analysis suggests that a true Heaviside step transition is a good approximation for most of the considered models, since most of the quantities weakly depend on the transition speed. We find that transitions occurring at redshifts $z_{\\rm t}\\gtrsim 2$ cannot be distinguished from the $Œõ$CDM model if dark energy is freezing, i.e., the corresponding equation of state tends to $-1$. For fast, recent transitions, the redshift at which the properties of dark energy have the most significant effect is $z=0.6\\pm 0.2$. We also find that in the freezing regime, the $œÉ_8$ values can be lowered by about $8\\%$, suggesting that those models could relieve the $œÉ_8$-tension. Additionally, freezing models generally predict faster late-time merging rates but a lower number of massive galaxies at $z=0$. Finally, the matter power spectrum for smooth dark energy shows a low-wavenumber peak which is absent in the clustering case.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, the model of the Einstein-Bardeen theory minimally coupled to a complex, massive, free scalar field was investigated in arXiv:2305.19057. The introduction of a scalar field disrupts the formation of an event horizon, leaving only a type of solution referred to as a Bardeen-boson star. When the magnetic charge $q$ exceeds a certain critical value, the frozen Bardeen-boson star can be obtained with $œâ\\rightarrow 0$. In this paper, we extend to the investigation of Einstein-Hayward-scalar model, and obtain the solution of frozen Hayward-boson star, including the ground and excited states. Furthermore, under the same parameters, it is interesting to observe that both the ground state and the excited states frozen stars have the same critical horizon and mass.",

We study both the case when the matter comes from a variational principle, as well as the case where the matter comes from a statistical or thermodynamic approach. For the latter, we construct the distribution function for the perfect fluid and its entropy current, which is a conserved quantity. We then include general viscous and elastic terms in the generalized energy-momentum tensor which, in the general case, lead to entropy production. We consistently deform the conservation law of the generalized entropy current and identify a particular non-dissipative deformation. Using the generalized fluid model, we revisit the issue of non-covariance of perfect fluids under T-dualities and we show how to resolve it in our DFT model with matter.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate a cosmological model wherein a waterfall symmetry breaking occurs during the radiation-dominated era. The model comprises a complex waterfall field, an axion field, and the gauge field (dark photon) generated through a tachyonic instability due to the Chern-Simons interaction. Prior to symmetry breaking, the total energy density incorporates a vacuum energy from the waterfall field, establishing a novel scenario for Early Dark Energy (EDE). Subsequent to the symmetry breaking, the dark photon dynamically acquires mass via the Higgs mechanism, potentially contributing to the dark matter abundance. Hence, our model can simultaneously address the $H_0$ tension and the origin of dark matter.",

        "Authors": "Ricardo Monteiro",
        "Abstract": "We revisit the question of whether classical general relativity obeys, beyond the linearised order, an analogue of the global U(1) electric-magnetic duality of Maxwell theory, with the Riemann tensor playing the role analogous to the field strength. Following contradictory claims in the literature, we present a simple gauge-invariant argument that the duality does not hold. The duality condition is the conservation of the helicity charge. Scattering amplitudes of gravitons in general relativity, and of gluons in Yang-Mills theory, violate this selection rule already at tree level. Indeed, the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes are famous for their simplicity. The duality in the linearised theories is, therefore, broken by the interactions. In contrast, the tree-level scattering amplitudes in duality-invariant theories of non-linear electromagnetism are known to obey helicity conservation. While the duality is not a symmetry of the full theory of general relativity, it does hold within a sector of the solution space, including vacuum type D solutions, where the duality is known to rotate between mass and NUT charge.",

Implementing massive higher-spin symmetry via a string-inspired BRST approach we construct an action that reproduces the correct cubic amplitude of Arkani-Hamed--Huang--Huang. The same is achieved for the root-Kerr theory, i.e. for the minimal electromagnetic interaction of a massive higher-spin field.",

        "Abstract": "In the past twenty years, many new hadrons that are difficult to be explained within the conventional quark model have been discovered in the quarkonium region, which are called exotic hadrons. Belle II experiment, as the next-generation $B$ factory, provides a good platform to explore them. The charmonium-like states can be produced at Belle II in several ways, such as $B$ meson decays, initial-state radiation processes, two-photon collisions, and double charmonium productions. The bottomonium-like states can be produced directly in $e^+e^-$ colliding energies at Belle II with low continuum backgrounds. Belle II plans to perform a high-statistics energy scan from the $B\\bar B$ threshold up to the highest possible energy of 11.24 GeV to search for new $Y_b$ states with $J^{PC}$ = $1^{--}$, $X_b$ (the bottom counterpart of $œá_{c1}(3872)$ (also known as $X(3872)$)), and partners of $Z_b$ states. In this paper, we give a mini-review on the status and prospects of exotic hadrons at Belle II.",

Such a representation of the CKM and PMNS matrices may indicate the $Z_{3}$ symmetry to be present in the Yukawa sector of the~SM. Identical mathematical structure of the CKM and PMNS matrices is also an extension of the quark-lepton universality. In this approach the CP violation is a natural consequence of the structure of the Yukawa couplings. The CP violating phase is not a fitted parameter and its value is governed by the parameters of two rotations. The parameters of the diagonalizing matrices of the bi-unitary transformation do not exhibit a hierarchy, which means that the origins of the hierarchy of quark masses and of the CKM matrix elements are not the same.",

        "Authors": "Eric M. Metodiev, Jesse Thaler, Raymond Wynne",
        "Abstract": "To maximize the discovery potential of high-energy colliders, experimental searches should be sensitive to unforeseen new physics scenarios. This goal has motivated the use of machine learning for unsupervised anomaly detection. In this paper, we introduce a new anomaly detection strategy called FORCE: factorized observables for regressing conditional expectations. Our approach is based on the inductive bias of factorization, which is the idea that the physics governing different energy scales can be treated as approximately independent. Assuming factorization holds separately for signal and background processes, the appearance of non-trivial correlations between low- and high-energy observables is a robust indicator of new physics. Under the most restrictive form of factorization, a machine-learned model trained to identify such correlations will in fact converge to the optimal new physics classifier. We test FORCE on a benchmark anomaly detection task for the Large Hadron Collider involving collimated sprays of particles called jets. By teasing out correlations between the kinematics and substructure of jets, our method can reliably extract percent-level signal fractions. This strategy for uncovering new physics adds to the growing toolbox of anomaly detection methods for collider physics with a complementary set of assumptions.",

        "Abstract": "A search is performed for charged-lepton flavor violating processes in top quark (t) production and decay. The data were collected by the CMS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The selected events are required to contain one opposite-sign electron-muon pair, a third charged lepton (electron or muon), and at least one jet of which no more than one is associated with a bottom quark. Boosted decision trees are used to distinguish signal from background, exploiting differences in the kinematics of the final states particles. The data are consistent with the standard model expectation. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed in the context of effective field theory on the Wilson coefficients, which range between 0.024-0.424 TeV$^{-2}$ depending on the flavor of the associated light quark and the Lorentz structure of the interaction.

The dual-site experiment will employ an intense neutrino beam focused on a near and a far detector as it aims to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to make high-precision measurements of the PMNS matrix parameters, including the CP-violating phase. It will also stand ready to observe supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector implements liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) technology, and combines the many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass necessary for rare event searches with the sub-centimeter spatial resolution required to image those events with high precision. The addition of a photon detection system enhances physics capabilities for all DUNE physics drivers and opens prospects for further physics explorations. Given its size, the far detector will be implemented as a set of modules, with LArTPC designs that differ from one another as newer technologies arise.\n  In the vertical drift LArTPC design, a horizontal cathode bisects the detector, creating two stacked drift volumes in which ionization charges drift towards anodes at either the top or bottom. The anodes are composed of perforated PCB layers with conductive strips, enabling reconstruction in 3D. Light-trap-style photon detection modules are placed both on the cryostat's side walls and on the central cathode where they are optically powered.\n  This Technical Design Report describes in detail the technical implementations of each subsystem of this LArTPC that, together with the other far detector modules and the near detector, will enable DUNE to achieve its physics goals.",

Within this context, we explore the possibility that the two Higgs doublets may serve as a window into CP-violating dark sectors, neutral under the SM gauge groups. Specifically, our focus is on investigating the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron, generated solely by CP violation in the dark sector. We present a general formula for the electron EDM, without specifying the structure of the dark sectors, and discuss the current constraints on various dark sector models. It is noteworthy that even in the case of a CP-conserving 2HDM, the resulting electron EDM is capable of reaching the current experimental limit, with CP violation arising exclusively from the dark sectors. Furthermore, we introduce a heavy dark sector (HDS) approximation for the analytic calculation of the EDM, assuming that the dark sector particles are much heavier than the physical states in the 2HDM. This approximation yields simplified analytic results that are consistent with the full numerical calculations.",

In particular, we show that the final state interaction effects lead to a nonzero longitudinal polarized quark distribution associated with the unpolarized nucleon target. This explains the observed beam single spin asymmetry (BSA) from a recent Jefferson Lab experiment.

In HALHF, beam-driven plasma-wakefield cells are used to accelerate electrons to high energy. Because plasma-based acceleration of positrons is problematic, conventional RF acceleration is used but to much lower energy. The HALHF concept utilises not only asymmetric energies but also asymmetric bunch charges and asymmetric transverse emittances, leading to comparable luminosity to conventional facilities but much lower capital cost. Possible upgrades to the HALHF facility are discussed, in particular to the $\\rm{t\\bar{t}}$ threshold and to 550 GeV, where the Higgs self-coupling and $\\rm{t\\bar{t}}H$ coupling can be measured. Other upgrades include the provision of two interaction points, to implement a $Œ≥$$\\unicode{x2013}$$Œ≥$ collider of two possible types and finally a symmetric high-energy collider if the problem of plasma-based positron acceleration can be solved.",

We demonstrate that a synergy of the updated direct detection results from DarkSide-50 and LUX-ZEPLIN together with IceCube bounds on high energy solar neutrinos from dark matter capture disfavour the viable parameter space of the dipolar dark matter scenario. Whereas, for the anapole dark matter scenario, a narrow window survives that lies within the reach of prospective heating signals due to the capture of dark matter at cold neutron stars.",

        "Abstract": "A search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) is presented, which considers the hadronic final state and coupling scenarios involving all three lepton generations in the 2-20 GeV HNL mass range for the first time. Events comprising two leptons (electrons or muons) and jets are analyzed in a data sample of proton-proton collisions, recorded with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. A novel jet tagger, based on a deep neural network, has been developed to identify jets from an HNL decay using various features of the jet and its constituent particles. The network output can be used as a powerful discriminating tool to probe a broad range of HNL lifetimes and masses. Contributions from background processes are determined from data. No excess of events in data over the expected background is observed. Upper limits on the HNL production cross section are derived as functions of the HNL mass and the three coupling strengths $V_{\\ell\\mathrm{N}}$ to each lepton generation $\\ell$ and presented as exclusion limits in the coupling-mass plane, as lower limits on the HNL lifetime, and on the HNL mass. In this search, the most stringent limit on the coupling strength is obtained for pure muon coupling scenarios; values of $\\lvert V_{Œº\\mathrm{N}}\\rvert^{2}\\gt $ 5 (4)$\\times$10$^{-7}$ are excluded for Dirac (Majorana) HNLs with a mass of 10 GeV at a confidence level of 95% that correspond to proper decay lengths of 17 (10) mm.",

        "Abstract": "We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), an experimental space wide-field (18.6*18.6 square degrees) X-ray telescope built from novel lobster eye mirco-pore optics. LEIA was successfully launched on July 27, 2022 onboard the SATech-01 satellite. To achieve full characterisation of its performance before launch, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module. In this paper, we present the results of the end-to-end calibration campaign of the complete module carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility at IHEP. The PSF, effective area and energy response of the detectors were measured in a wide range of incident directions at several X-ray line energies. The distributions of the PSF and effective areas are roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. The mild variations and deviations from the prediction of idealized lobster-eye optics can be understood to be caused by the imperfect shapes and alignment of the micro-pores as well as the obscuration by the supporting frames, which can be well reproduced by MC simulations. The spatial resolution of LEIA defined by the FWHM of the focal spot ranges from 4-8 arcmin with a median of 5.7. The measured effective areas are in range of 2-3 $cm^2$ at ~1.25 keV across the entire FoV, and its dependence on photon energy is in large agreement with simulations. The gains of the CMOS sensors are in range of 6.5-6.9 eV/DN, and the energy resolutions in the range of ~120-140 eV at 1.25 keV and ~170-190 eV at 4.5 keV. These results have been ingested into the calibration database and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by LEIA. This work paves the way for the calibration of the Wide-field X-Ray Telescope modules of the Einstein Probe mission.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to improve the performance of event classification in collider physics by introducing a pre-training strategy. Event classification is a typical problem in collider physics, where the goal is to distinguish the signal events of interest from background events as much as possible to search for new phenomena in nature. A pre-training strategy with feasibility to efficiently train the target event classification using a small amount of training data has been proposed. Real particle collision data were used in the pre-training phase as a novelty, where a self-supervised learning technique to handle the unlabeled data was employed. The ability to use real data in the pre-training phase eliminates the need to generate a large amount of training data by simulation and mitigates bias in the choice of physics processes in the training data. Our experiments using CMS open data confirmed that high event classification performance can be achieved by introducing a pre-trained model. This pre-training strategy provides a potential approach to save computational resources for future collider experiments and introduces a foundation model for event classification.",

        "Authors": "Shawn Westerdale",
        "Abstract": "As liquid argon (LAr) detectors are made at progressively larger sizes, accurate models of LAr optical properties become increasingly important for simulating light transport, understanding signals, and developing analyses. The refractive index, group velocity, and Rayleigh scattering length are particularly important for vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and visible photons in detectors with diameters much greater than one meter. While optical measurements in the VUV are sparse, recent measurements of the group velocity of 128 nm photons in LAr provide valuable constraints on these parameters. These calculations are further complicated by the dependence of optical parameters on thermodynamic properties that might fluctuate or vary throughout the argon volume. This manuscript presents the model used by DEAP-3600, a dark matter direct detection experiment at SNOLAB using a 3.3 tonne LAr scintillation counter. Existing data and thermodynamic models are synthesized to estimate the wavelength-dependent refractive index, group velocity, and Rayleigh scattering length within the detector, and parameters' uncertainties are estimated. This model, along with in situ measurements of LAr scintillation properties, is benchmarked against data collected in DEAP-3600, providing a method for modeling optical properties in large LAr detectors and for propagating their uncertainties through downstream simulations. Updates are also presented of the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST) software, widely used to model scintillation and ionization signals in argon- and xenon-based detectors.",

        "Abstract": "It has long been recognized that the scattering of electroweak particles at very high energies is dominated by vector boson fusion, which probes the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and offers a unique window into the ultraviolet regime of the SM. Previous studies assume SM-like couplings and rely on the effective $W$ approximation (or electroweak parton distribution), whose validity is well-established within the SM but not yet studied in the presence of anomalous Higgs couplings. In this work, we critically examine the electroweak production of two Higgs bosons in the presence of anomalous $VVh$ and $VVhh$ couplings. We compute the corresponding helicity amplitudes and compare the cross section results in the effective $W$ approximation with the full fixed-order calculation. In particular, we identify two distinct classes of anomalous Higgs couplings, whose effects are not captured by vector boson fusion and effective $W$ approximation. Such very high energy electroweak scatterings can be probed at the Muon Shot, a multi-TeV muon collider upon which we base our study, although similar considerations apply to other high energy colliders.",

        "Authors": "Masahiro Ibe, Yuhei Nakayama, Satoshi Shirai",
        "Abstract": "Higgsinos and Winos in the supersymmetric Standard Model are prime candidates for dark matter due to their weakly interacting nature. The mass differences between their charged components (charginos) and neutral components (neutralinos) become degenerate when other superparticles are heavy, resulting in long-lived charginos. In the case of the Winos, the mass difference is approximately 160 MeV across a wide range of the parameter space. Consequently, the chargino decays into the lightest neutralino, emitting a single charged pion. For Higgsinos, however, mass differences ranging from O(0.1) GeV to O(1) GeV are possible, leading to a variety of decay channels. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis of Wino decay to the chargino with a larger mass difference. We emphasize characterizing its decay signatures through leptonic and hadronic modes. By utilizing the latest experimental data, we perform a comprehensive study of the decay rate calculations incorporating these hadronic modes to determine the impact on the predicted chargino lifetime. Additionally, we conduct next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations for the leptonic decay modes. Our NLO results can be applied to the case of more general fermionic electroweak multiplets, e.g., quintuplet dark matter.",

The Higgs boson candidates are either reconstructed from pairs of resolved b-tagged jets, or from single large distance parameter jets containing the particles arising from two b quarks. Proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment in 2016-2018 and corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, are analyzed. The inclusive signal strength, defined as the product of the observed production cross section and branching fraction relative to the standard model expectation, combining all analysis categories, is found to be $Œº$ = 1.15$^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$.

        "Authors": "Wen-Ying Liu, Hua-Xing Chen",
        "Abstract": "A lot of exotic hadrons were reported in the past twenty years, which bring us the renaissance of the hadron spectroscopy. Most of them can be understood as hadronic molecules, whose interactions are mainly due to the exchange of light mesons, and specifically, light vector mesons through the coupled-channel unitary approach within the local hidden-gauge formalism. It is still controversial whether the interaction arising from the exchange of heavy mesons is capable of forming hadronic molecules. We apply the coupled-channel unitary approach to study the fully-heavy $b \\bar b c \\bar c$ system, where the exchanged mesons can only be the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/œà$, $B_c^*$, and $Œ•$. Especially, the $J/œà$ meson is much lighter than the $B_c^{(*)}$ mesons, so the present study can be taken as a general investigation on the question whether a lower-mass fully-heavy meson is able to bind two higher-mass fully-heavy hadrons. Our results suggest the existence of the fully-heavy hadronic molecules $|B_c^{+} B_c^{-}; J^{PC}=0^{++} \\rangle$, $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} - c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{+-} \\rangle$, and $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{*-}; J^{PC}=2^{++} \\rangle$ as well as the possible existence of $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} + c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{++} \\rangle$. These states are potentially to be observed in the $Œº^+ Œº^- J/œà$ and $Œº^+ Œº^- Œ•$ channels in future ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The study of heavy-flavour mesons and baryons in hadronic collisions provides unique access to the properties of heavy-quark hadronisation in the presence of large partonic densities, where new mechanisms of hadron formation beyond in-vacuum fragmentation can emerge. Performing these measurements in intervals of charged-particle multiplicities across different collision systems provides sensitivity to understand whether different hadronisation mechanisms are at play in small and large hadronic colliding systems.\n  In this contribution, a selection of the latest charm and beauty production measurements in proton--proton (pp) collisions is presented, which can shed light on the modification of the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanisms with respect to leptonic collisions. New published results of the production of all prompt charm ground states in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, which allowed us to measure the charm fragmentation fractions and the total $\\rm c\\bar{c}$ production cross section at midrapidity, will be shown. The new final measurement of non-prompt (i.e. originating from beauty-hadron decays) $\\rm Œõ_c^+$ baryons in the same collisions system will be discussed to provide a quantitative comparison between the hadronisation properties of beauty and charm hadrons. New measurements of $\\rm Œû_c^0$ production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, and of $\\rm Œû_c^0$ production in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$~TeV, will be also presented, shedding further light on the hadronisation of charm-strange baryons in different colliding systems.",

        "Authors": "Hosein Hashemi, Claudius Krause",
        "Abstract": "In modern collider experiments, the quest to explore fundamental interactions between elementary particles has reached unparalleled levels of precision. Signatures from particle physics detectors are low-level objects encoding the physics of collisions. The complete simulation of them in a detector is a memory and storage-intensive task. To address this computational bottleneck in particle physics, \"Fast Simulation\" has been introduced and refined over the years. The field has seen a surge in interest in surrogate modeling the detector simulation, fueled by the advancements in deep generative models. These models aim to generate responses that are statistically identical to the observed data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and exhaustive taxonomic review of the existing literature on the simulation of detector signatures from both methodological and application-wise perspectives. Initially, we formulate the problem of detector signature simulation and discuss its different variations that can be unified. Next, we classify the state-of-the-art methods into four distinct categories based on their underlying model architectures, summarizing their respective generation strategies. We then identify and discuss three key application areas. Finally, we shed light on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in detector signature simulation, setting the stage for future research and development.",

        "Authors": "Gabriel Dale-Gau",
        "Abstract": "Measurements at RHIC and the LHC show strongly enhanced baryon-to-meson yield ratios at intermediate transverse momenta ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) in high-energy nuclear collisions compared to $p$+$p$ baseline. This enhancement is attributed to the following QGP effects: strong hydrodynamic flow and parton recombination. Jet probes have been used extensively to gain insights into QGP properties, with substantial modifications to jet yields and internal structures seen across multiple measurements. Despite apparent medium-induced changes to jet fragmentation patterns, the LHC results indicate that in-jet baryon-to-meson ratios remain similar to that of $p$+$p$ measurements and are significantly different from that of the QGP bulk. To explore this behavior at RHIC, we employ particle identification through time-of-flight and TPC $dE/dx$ information alongside jet-track correlations to measure in-jet particle ratios for $p_{\\rm{T}} < 5.0$ GeV/$c$. We present the first in-cone baryon-to-meson yield ratios associated with fully reconstructed jets from Au+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC.",

        "Abstract": "DarkSide-20k is a next-generation dual-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, currently under construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. With a 20 t fiducial mass of liquid Argon, DarkSide-20k will probe WIMP-nucleon interactions down to cross sections equal to 10$^{-48}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 0.1 TeV/c$^2$. DarkSide-20k is designed to be a nearly \"instrumental background-free\" experiment, meaning that less than 0.1 background events are expected in the WIMP search region during the 200 tonne-year planned exposure. To achieve this, the TPC is surrounded by an inner (neutron) and outer (muon) veto, while low-radioactivity underground argon (depleted in $^{39}$Ar), is used as the inner detector (TPC and inner veto) medium. Both the TPC and the veto systems are instrumented with novel cryogenic silicon photomultiplier, capable of resolving single photoelectrons and providing the required spatial and time resolution. An overview of the DarkSide-20k experimental program is reported, with a focus on the photo-detector system construction and testing procedures for the inner veto system.",

        "Authors": "Pouya Asadi, Aria Radick, Tien-Tien Yu",
        "Abstract": "We study a Lepton-Flavored Dark Matter model and its signatures at a future Muon Collider. We focus on the less-explored regime of feeble dark matter interactions, which suppresses the dangerous lepton-flavor violating processes, gives rise to dark matter freeze-in production, and leads to long-lived particle signatures at colliders. We find that the interplay of dark matter freeze-in and its mediator freeze-out gives rise to an upper bound of around TeV scales on the dark matter mass. The signatures of this model depend on the lifetime of the mediator, and can range from generic prompt decays to more exotic long-lived particle signals. In the prompt region, we calculate the signal yield, study useful kinematics cuts, and report tolerable systematics that would allow for a $5œÉ$ discovery. In the long-lived region, we calculate the number of charged tracks and displaced lepton signals of our model in different parts of the detector, and uncover kinematic features that can be used for background rejection. We show that, unlike in hadron colliders, multiple production channels contribute significantly which leads to sharply distinct kinematics for electroweakly-charged long-lived particle signals. Ultimately, the collider signatures of this lepton-flavored dark matter model are common amongst models of electroweak-charged new physics, rendering this model a useful and broadly applicable benchmark model for future Muon Collider studies that can help inform work on detector design and studies of systematics.",

In the hadronic molecule picture, this new structure can be associated with the shallow isoscalar $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ bound state and as such is an excellent candidate for the spin-2 partner of the $X(3872)$ with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ conventionally named $X_2$. In this work we evaluate the electronic width of this new state and argue that its nature is sensitive to its total width, the experimental measurement currently available being unable to distinguish between different options. Our estimates demonstrate that the planned Super $œÑ$-Charm Facility offers a promising opportunity to search for and study this new state in the invariant mass distributions for the final states $J/œàŒ≥$ and $œà(2S)Œ≥$.",

Like in the case of dark matter scattering on nuclei, electron-recoil-based searches also face an ultimate background in the form of neutrinos. The so-called \"neutrino fog'' refers to the range of open dark-matter parameter space where the background of neutrinos can potentially prevent a conclusive discovery claim of a dark matter signal from being made. In this study, we map the neutrino fog for a range of electron recoil experiments based on silicon, germanium, xenon and argon targets. In analogy to the nuclear recoil case, we also calculate the \"edge'' to the neutrino fog, which can be used as a visual guide to where neutrinos become an important background -- this boundary excludes some parts of the key theory milestones used to motivate these experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories is a crucial challenge of particle physics experiments as it directly impacts particle reconstruction and physics performances. To reconstruct these trajectories, different reconstruction algorithms are used sequentially. Each of these algorithms uses many configuration parameters that must be fine-tuned to properly account for the detector/experimental setup, the available CPU budget and the desired physics performance. Examples of such parameters are cut values limiting the algorithm's search space, approximations accounting for complex phenomenons, or parameters controlling algorithm performance. Until now, these parameters had to be optimised by human experts, which is inefficient and raises issues for the long-term maintainability of such algorithms. Previous experience using machine learning for particle reconstruction (such as the TrackML challenge) has shown that they can be easily adapted to different experiments by learning directly from the data. We propose to bring the same approach to the classic track reconstruction algorithms by connecting them to an agent-driven optimiser, allowing us to find the best input parameters using an iterative tuning approach. We have so far demonstrated this method on different track reconstruction algorithms within A Common Tracking Software (ACTS) framework using the Open Data Detector (ODD). These algorithms include the trajectory seed reconstruction and selection, the particle vertex reconstruction and the generation of simplified material maps used for trajectory reconstruction.",

We also provide valuable guidance in searching new heavy-light mesons by the detailed predictions of their masses, widths, and branching ratios.

        "Abstract": "The silicon vertex detector (SVD) is installed at the heart of the Belle II experiment, taking data at the high-luminosity $B$-Factory SuperKEKB since 2019. The detector has shown a stable and above-99\\% hit efficiency, with a large signal-to-noise in all sensors since the beginning of data taking. Cluster position and time resolution have been measured with 2020 and 2022 data and show excellent performance and stability. The effect of radiation damage is visible, but not affecting the performance. As the luminosity increases, higher machine backgrounds are expected and the excellent hit-time information in SVD can be exploited for background rejection. In particular, we have recently developed a novel procedure to select hits by grouping them event-by-event based on their time. This new procedure allows a significant reduction of the fake rate, while preserving the tracking efficiency, and it has therefore replaced the previous cut-based procedure. We have developed a method that uses the SVD hits to estimate the track time (previously unavailable) and the collision time. It has a similar precision to the estimate based on the drift chamber but its execution time is three orders of magnitude smaller, allowing a faster online reconstruction that is crucial in a high luminosity regime. The track time is a powerful information provided to analysis that allows, together with the above-mention grouping selection, to raise the occupancy limit above that expected at nominal luminosity, leaving room for a safety factor. Finally, in June 2022 the data taking of the Belle II experiment was stopped to install a new two-layer DEPFET detector (PXD) and upgrade components of the accelerator. The whole silicon tracker (PXD+SVD) has been extracted from Belle II, the new PXD installed, the detector closed and commissioned. We briefly describe the SVD results of this upgrade.",

        "Abstract": "With machine learning applications now spanning a variety of computational tasks, multi-user shared computing facilities are devoting a rapidly increasing proportion of their resources to such algorithms. Graph neural networks (GNNs), for example, have provided astounding improvements in extracting complex signatures from data and are now widely used in a variety of applications, such as particle jet classification in high energy physics (HEP). However, GNNs also come with an enormous computational penalty that requires the use of GPUs to maintain reasonable throughput. At shared computing facilities, such as those used by physicists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), methodical resource allocation and high throughput at the many-user scale are key to ensuring that resources are being used as efficiently as possible. These facilities, however, primarily provide CPU-only nodes, which proves detrimental to time-to-insight and computational throughput for workflows that include machine learning inference. In this work, we describe how a shared computing facility can use the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to optimize its resource allocation and computing structure, recovering high throughput while scaling out to multiple users by massively parallelizing their machine learning inference. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system in a realistic multi-user environment, we use the Fermilab Elastic Analysis Facility augmented with the Triton Inference Server to provide scalable and high throughput access to a HEP-specific GNN and report on the outcome.",

Regarding the Frame we introduce the basic concept and highlight some of the functionality as well as important aspects of its implementation. The usage of podio for generating different EDMs for future collider projects (most importantly EDM4hep, the common EDM for the Key4hep project) has inspired new features. We present some of those smaller new features and end with a brief overview on current developments towards a first stable version as well as an outlook on future developments beyond that.",

The mass number scaling of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ and $v_{3}(p_{T})$ of light nuclei is discussed. We also report the comparison of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ and $v_{3}(p_{T})$ of light nuclei with a transport-plus-coalescence model calculation.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate the reach for resonances of the composite Higgs models at a 10 TeV Œº^+Œº^- collider with up to 10 ab^{-1} luminosity. The strong dynamics sector is modeled by the minimal coset SO(5)/SO(4), where vector resonances are in (3, 1) of SO(4) and fermions are in (2, 2). Various production and decay channels are studied. For the spin-1 resonances, the projections are made based on the radiative return and vector boson fusion production channels. The muon collider can cover most of the kinematically allowed mass range and can measure the coupling g_œÅto percent level. For the fermionic resonances (i.e. the top partners), pair production easily covers the resonance mass below 5 TeV, while single production extends the reach to 6 TeV for a small Œæ= 0.015.",

The dual-site experiment will employ an intense neutrino beam focused on both a near detector and a cryogenic far detector. The DUNE far detector implements liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) technology, and combines many tens-of-kilotons of fiducial mass with sub-centimeter spatial resolution to collect neutrino events and image them with high precision. Given its size, this detector will be implemented as a set of up to four modules, each of which will require its own cryostat that will contain approximately 17.5 metric kilotons of ultra-pure liquid argon (LAr). The cryogenics infrastructure to support the detector modules includes systems to receive, transfer, store, purify, and maintain the LAr. This design report describes the cryostats and the cryogenics infrastructure required for the first two detector modules; this infrastructure is designed to support expansion to up to four far detector modules.",

        "Abstract": "We present an evaluation of the glueball spectrum for configurations produced with $N_f=1$ dynamical fermions as a function of the $m_{\\rm PCAC}$ mass. We obtained masses of states that fall into the irreducible representations of the octahedral group of rotations in combination with the quantum numbers of charge conjugation $C$ and parity $P$. Due to the low signal to noise ratio, practically, we can only extract masses for the irreducible representations $R^{PC}=$ $A_1^{++}$, $E^{++}$, $T_2^{++}$ as well as $A_1^{-+}$. We make use of the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEVP) with an operator basis consisting only of gluonic operators. Throughout this work we are aiming towards the identification of the effects of light dynamical quarks on the glueball spectrum and how this compares to the statistically more precise spectrum of SU(3) pure gauge theory. We used large gauge ensembles which consist of ${\\sim {~\\cal O}}(10 {\\rm K})$ configurations. Our findings demonstrate that the low-lying spectrum of the scalar, tensor as well as pseudo-scalar glueballs receive negligible contributions from the inclusion of $N_f=1$ dynamical fermions.",

Recent results pointed out that fermionic systems can exhibit stronger entanglement than bosonic systems, exhibiting a negativity that decays only algebraically. The Schwinger model is described by fermionic excitations at short distances, while its asymptotic spectrum is the one of a bosonic theory. We show that the two-mode negativity detects this confining, fermion-to-boson transition, shifting from an algebraic decay to an exponential decay at distances of the order of the de Broglie wavelength of the first excited state. We derive analytical expressions in the massless Schwinger model and confront them with tensor network simulations. We also perform tensor network simulations in the massive model, which is not solvable analytically, and close to the Ising quantum critical point of the Schwinger model, where we show that the negativity behaves as its bosonic counterpart.",

        "Abstract": "Topological interfaces of two-dimensional conformal field theories contain information about symmetries of the theory and exhibit striking spectral and entanglement characteristics. While lattice realizations of these interfaces have been proposed for unitary minimal models, the same has remained elusive for the paradigmatic Luttinger liquid {\\it i.e.,} the free, compact boson model. Here, we show that a topological interface of two Luttinger liquids can be realized by coupling special one-dimensional superconductors. The gapless excitations in the latter carry charges that are specific integer multiples of the charge of Cooper-pairs. The aforementioned integers are determined by the windings in the target space of the bosonic fields -- a crucial element required to give rise to nontrivial topological interfaces. The latter occur due to the perfect transmission of certain number of Cooper-pairs across the interface. The topological interfaces arise naturally in Josephson junction arrays with the simplest case being realized by an array of experimentally-demonstrated~$0-œÄ$ qubits, capacitors and ordinary Josephson junctions. Signatures of the topological interface are obtained through entanglement entropy computations. In particular, the subleading contribution to the so-called interface entropy is shown to differ from existing field theory predictions. The proposed lattice model provides an experimentally-realizable alternative to spin and anyon chains for the analysis of several conjectured conformal fixed points which have so far eluded ab-initio investigation.",

We show that in the chiral limit the instanton gas splits into a free gas component with a density proportional to $m^{N_f}$ and a gas of instanton-antiinstanton molecules. While the latter do not influence the chiral properties, for any nonzero quark mass the free gas component produces a singular spectral peak at zero that dominates Banks-Casher type spectral sums. By calculating these we show that the difference of the pion and delta susceptibility vanishes only for three or more massless flavors, however, the chiral condensate is zero already for two massless flavors",

Similarities to staggered fermions exist, namely, spin and taste degrees of freedom become intertwined, and a remnant, non-singlet chiral symmetry and ultralocality are maintained. However, charge conjugation, isotropy and some space-time reflection symmetries are broken by the cutoff. For two variants, i.e., Karsten-Wilczek (KW) or Borici-Creutz (BC) fermions, a tasted charge conjugation symmetry can be identified, and the respective representations of the spin-taste algebra can be constructed explicitly. In the case of BC fermions, the tasted symmetry indicates that amendments to the published counterterms are necessary. The spin-taste representation on the quark level permits construction of local or extended hadron interpolating operators for any spin-taste combination, albeit with contamination by parity partners and taste-symmetry violation. The few available numerical results for KW fermions are in line with expectations.",

By explicitly incorporating one-pion exchange, the approach quantitatively accounts for effects related to left-hand cuts and range corrections from the longest-range interactions. The method utilizes the plane wave basis instead of the conventional partial wave expansion, thereby also naturally including partial wave mixing effects resulting from rotational symmetry breaking in a cubic box. Applied to the lattice data for $DD^*$ scattering at a pion mass of 280 MeV, it reveals the significant impact of the one-pion exchange on P-wave and S-wave phase shifts. The pole position of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ state, extracted from the finite-volume energy levels while taking into account left-hand cut effects, range corrections, and partial-wave mixing, appears to be consistent with a near-threshold resonance.",

        "Abstract": "Double beta decays are rare nuclear processes that can occur in two modes: two-neutrino double beta decay, observed in the Standard Model, and neutrinoless double beta decay, a hypothetical process with profound implications for Particle Physics. To draw reliable conclusions from their experimental constraints, it is necessary to have accurate predictions of the underlying hadronic interactions described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a non-Abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group SU(3). QCD predictions require non-perturbative methods for calculating observables, and lattice QCD (LQCD), a numerical method based on QCD formulated on a finite space-time grid, is the only reliable first-principles technique for obtaining quantitative results. However, LQCD needs formal prescriptions to match numerical results with observables. This thesis provides such prescriptions for double beta decays using the finite volume effects in the LQCD framework. Matching relations that connect two-nucleon double beta decay amplitudes to quantities accessible via LQCD calculations, namely the nuclear matrix elements and two-nucleon energy spectra in a finite volume are provided. The impact of uncertainties is examined on the precision with which low-energy constants of the corresponding effective field theories can be determined from future LQCD calculations.\n  Hamiltonian simulation of QCD is another non-perturbative method of solving QCD which can be more suitable in some cases than the conventional LQCD. The rise of tensor network methods and quantum simulation has made Hamiltonian simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) a reality. Towards the goal of simulating QCD, a loop-string-hadron (LSH) formulation of an SU(3) LGT with matter in 1+1 dimensions is developed in this thesis, motivated by recent studies that showed the LSH formulation of an SU(2) LGT to be advantageous over other formulations.",

As a result, we show that the calculation is valid only when the directional vectors obey the relation: $|r| = |n^3/n^0| > 1$, and that this result corresponds to a computation in Minkowski space with space-like directed Wilson lines. Finally, we show that a lattice calculable object can be constructed that has the desired properties of the soft function.",

        "Authors": "Viktoria Noel, Daniel Spitz",
        "Abstract": "We study nonequilibrium dynamics of relativistic $N$-component scalar field theories in Minkowski space-time in a classical-statistical regime, where typical occupation numbers of modes are much larger than unity. In this strongly correlated system far from equilibrium, the role of different phenomena such as nonlinear wave propagation and defect dynamics remains to be clarified. We employ persistent homology to infer topological features of the nonequilibrium many-body system for different numbers of field components $N$ via a hierarchy of cubical complexes. Specifically, we show that the persistent homology of local energy density fluctuations can give rise to signatures of self-similar scaling associated with topological defects, distinct from the scaling behaviour of nonlinear wave modes. This contributes to the systematic understanding of the role of topological defects for far-from-equilibrium time evolutions of nonlinear many-body systems.",

        "Abstract": "To accelerate the HMC with field transformation, we consider a variant of the trivializing map, the decimation map, which can be regarded as a coarse-graining transformation. Using the 2D $U(1)$ pure gauge model, combined with the guided Monte Carlo algorithm, we show that the integrated autocorrelation time of the topological charge can be exponentially improved in the wall clock time. Our study indicates that incorporating renormalization group picture is a powerful and essential ingredient to accelerate the HMC at large $Œ≤$.",

        "Authors": "Jin Zhang, Shan-Wen Tsai, Yannick Meurice",
        "Abstract": "We consider multileg ladders of Rydberg atoms which have been proposed as quantum simulators for the compact Abelian Higgs model (CAHM) in 1+1 dimensions [Y. Meurice, Phys. Rev. D 104, 094513 (2021)] and modified versions of theses simulators such as triangular prisms. Starting with the physical Hamiltonian for the analog simulator, we construct translation-invariant effective Hamiltonians by integrating over the simulator high-energy states produced by the blockade mechanism when some of the atoms are sufficiently close to each others. Remarkably, for all the simulators considered, the effective Hamiltonians have the three types of terms present for the CAHM (Electric field, matter charge and currents energies) but, in addition, terms quartic in the electric field. For the two leg ladder, these additional terms cannot be removed by fine-tuning the adjustable parameters of currently available devices. For positive detuning, the new terms create highly-degenerate vacua resulting in a very interesting phase diagram. Using numerical methods, we demonstrate the close correspondence between the physical simulator and the effective description for the ground state energy and real-time evolution. We discuss the phase diagram at fixed geometry with variable Rabi frequency and detuning and show that a rich variety of phases can be reached with potential interest in the context of QCD at finite density. We illustrate how the effective description can be used to design simulators with desirable properties from the point of view of constructing hybrid event generators.",

A good qualitative agreement between our results and the lattice ones is observed. In addition, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature.

This study sets the stage for future precision calculations with dynamical fermions in the low mass region of lattice parameter space. Our results have potential phenomenological applications ranging from composite Higgs models, to top (partial) compositeness, to dark matter models with composite, strong-coupling dynamical origin. Having adopted the Wilson flow as a scale-setting procedure, we apply Wilson chiral perturbation theory to extract the continuum and massless limits for the observables of interest. The resulting measurements are used to perform a simplified extrapolation to the large-$N$ limit, hence drawing a preliminary connection with gauge theories with unitary groups. We conclude with a brief discussion of the Weinberg sum rules.",

Accordingly, quark-gluon plasma generally includes some partial cells called center domains, each with a homogeneous Polyakov-loop expectation value. In this work, constructing an effective action describing the deconfinement vacuum of Yang-Mills theory with $N$ colors, we discuss the properties of center domains. First, we evaluate the spatial correlation of local Polyakov-loop fluctuation and demonstrate that some fluctuation becomes a Nambu-Goldstone-like mode in the large-$N$ limit. We also discuss surface tension between two $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ center domains. Second, we estimate the global vacuum-to-vacuum transition in a single center domain. We find that some threshold volume exists, where a domain larger than this volume is stable, and vice versa. Identifying the threshold as the lower bound of a stable center domain volume, we quantitatively argue the typical volume scale of center domains.",

Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical potential to baryon chemical potential, $Œº_{\\rm Q}/Œº_{\\rm B}$, shows significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies from the ratio of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions. These results can provide baselines for effective theory and model studies, and both $œá_{11}^{\\rm BQ}$ and $Œº_{\\rm Q}/Œº_{\\rm B}$ could be useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron resonance gas model.",

To overcome such constraints, this research focuses on optimising variational quantum algorithms to probe the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Physics-inspired circuit designs are tailored to alleviate coherence constraints, facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of materials at elevated temperatures.

The chapter analyses the issues of string momentum in higher orders. It discusses at length the powerful covariant calculus, to systematically construct EST's to arbitrary orders. The most general actions to $R^{-7}$ order are shown to be governed by just two parameters. The works of Aharony and collaborators on the spectrum of EST's, both in static and conformal gauges,to $R^{-5}$ order, and their results that even at that order the ground state energy remains the same as that of BST, but the excited spectrum gets corrected for $D\\,>\\,3$, are explained. It discusses the simulation results for excited states. It also discusses the AdS-CFT approaches and thickness of flux tubes.Recent works on the path-integral approaches to this issue are also discussed and compared with the other approaches.

We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.",

        "Authors": "Wen-Ying Liu, Hua-Xing Chen",
        "Abstract": "A lot of exotic hadrons were reported in the past twenty years, which bring us the renaissance of the hadron spectroscopy. Most of them can be understood as hadronic molecules, whose interactions are mainly due to the exchange of light mesons, and specifically, light vector mesons through the coupled-channel unitary approach within the local hidden-gauge formalism. It is still controversial whether the interaction arising from the exchange of heavy mesons is capable of forming hadronic molecules. We apply the coupled-channel unitary approach to study the fully-heavy $b \\bar b c \\bar c$ system, where the exchanged mesons can only be the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/œà$, $B_c^*$, and $Œ•$. Especially, the $J/œà$ meson is much lighter than the $B_c^{(*)}$ mesons, so the present study can be taken as a general investigation on the question whether a lower-mass fully-heavy meson is able to bind two higher-mass fully-heavy hadrons. Our results suggest the existence of the fully-heavy hadronic molecules $|B_c^{+} B_c^{-}; J^{PC}=0^{++} \\rangle$, $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} - c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{+-} \\rangle$, and $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{*-}; J^{PC}=2^{++} \\rangle$ as well as the possible existence of $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} + c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{++} \\rangle$. These states are potentially to be observed in the $Œº^+ Œº^- J/œà$ and $Œº^+ Œº^- Œ•$ channels in future ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The computation of the glueball spectrum is particularly challenging due to the rapid decay of the signal-to-noise ratio of the correlation functions. To address this issue, advanced techniques such as gauge link smearing and the variational method are commonly employed to identify the spectrum before the signal diminishes significantly. However, a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved by utilising multilevel sampling techniques. In this talk, we present a study of the glueball spectrum in pure gauge theory with a two-level algorithm. Specifically, we explore the relation between noise reduction and the various multilevel parameters, such as the width of the dynamical regions and the number of submeasurements.",

        "Abstract": "We present a proposal for calculating the running of the coupling constant of the $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ pure-gauge theory, which combines the Twisted Gradient Flow (TGF) renormalization scheme with Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC). The TGF is a gradient flow-based renormalization scheme formulated in an asymmetric lattice with twisted boundary conditions. Combined with step scaling, it has been successfully used to calculate the $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ $Œõ$ parameter. As with all gradient flow-based schemes, the coupling constant is highly correlated with the topological charge and affected by topology freezing, an issue addressed by projecting the determination of the coupling onto the zero topological sector. As an alternative to the zero-charge projection, we combine TGF with PTBC, by replicating multiple copies of the same lattice, interpolating between periodic and open boundary conditions in a parallel-tempered manner. We present a first exploration of these ideas by analyzing specific ensembles of $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattices with and without PTBC.",

        "Abstract": "I study QCD at large isospin density, which is known to be in the superfluid state with Cooper pairs carrying the same quantum number as pions. I solve the gap equation derived from the perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order corrections. The pairing gap at large isospin chemical potential is found to be enhanced compared to the color-superconducting gap at large baryon chemical potential due to the $\\sqrt{2}$ difference in the exponent arising from the stronger attraction in one-gluon exchange in the singlet channel. Then, using the gap function, I evaluate the contribution of the condensation energy of the superfluid state to the QCD equation of state. At isospin chemical potential of a few GeV, where the lattice QCD and the perturbative QCD can be both applied, the effect of the condensation energy becomes dominant even compared to the next-to-leading order corrections to the pressure in the perturbation theory. It resolves the discrepancy between the recent lattice QCD results and the perturbative QCD result.",

        "Authors": "G. Ramalho",
        "Abstract": "The $Œ≥^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transition has a property that differs from the other low lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the transverse helicity amplitudes. The transition helicity amplitudes are defined in terms of square transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small. This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at the pseudothreshold (the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at rest and $Q^2 <0$), where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large $Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge invariant parametrization of the $Œ≥^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transition current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of two {\\it elementary} form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the correlation between the these elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$. The description the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$, a region with almost non existent data. We conclude at the end that the low $Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.",

We perform simulations for the 2D Ising model with ferromagnetic couplings both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field using a cluster spin-flip algorithm. We show that it is possible to extract genuine signature of Lee Yang and Fisher zeros of the theory through the poles of magnetization and specific heat, using multi-point Pad√© method. We extract the poles of magnetization using Pad√© approximants and compare their scaling with known results. We verify the circle theorem associated to the well known behaviour of Lee Yang zeros. We present our finite volume scaling analysis of the zeros done at $T=T_c$ for a few lattice sizes, extracting to a very good precision the (combination of) critical exponents $Œ≤Œ¥$. The computation at the critical temperature is performed after the latter has been determined via the study of Fisher zeros, thus extracting both $Œ≤_c$ and the critical exponent $ŒΩ$. Results already exist for extracting the critical exponents for the Ising model in 2 and 3 dimensions making use of Fisher and Lee Yang zeros. In this work, multi-point Pad√© is shown to be competitive with this respect and thus a powerful tool to study phase transitions.",

        "Abstract": "As the study of three-hadron physics from lattice QCD matures, it is necessary to develop proper analysis tools in order to reliably study a variety of phenomena, including resonance spectroscopy and nuclear structure. Reconstructing the three-particle scattering amplitude requires solving integral equations, which can be written in terms of data-constrained dynamical functions and physical on-shell quantities. The driving term in these equations is the so-called one-particle exchange, which leads to a kinematic divergence for particles on-mass-shell. A vital component in defining three-particle amplitudes with definite parity and total angular momentum, which are used in spectroscopic studies, is to project the one-particle exchange into definite partial waves. We present a general procedure to construct exact analytic partial wave projections of the one-particle exchange contribution for any system composed of three spinless hadrons. Our result allows one full control over the analytic structure of the projection, which we explore for some low-lying partial waves with applications to three pions.",

The improvements are verified by performing numerical tests on the derived expressions using classical real-time lattice gauge theory simulations. We demonstrate substantial reductions in relative error of one to several orders of magnitude compared to a naive discretization for both energy and momentum conservation equations.

We find that, if the continuum limit is approached at fixed spatial volume, the restoration of taste symmetry leads to sizeable systematic effects on estimates for the mobility edge obtained from spectral statistics, which become larger and larger as the lattice spacing is decreased. Such systematics, however, are found to decrease if the volume is increased at fixed lattice spacing. Using an independent analysis based directly on the properties of the Dirac eigenvectors, that are unaffected by taste degeneracy, we show that taking the thermodynamic limit before the continuum limit leads to the correct result for the mobility edge estimated from spectral statistics. This allows us to obtain a controlled continuum extrapolation of the mobility edge for the first time.",

Such observation of high energy gamma-ray bursts from distant source causes a mystery since high energy photons suffer severe attenuation before reaching the earth. One possibility is the existence of axion-like particles (ALP), and high energy photons at the source can convert to these ALPs which travel intergalactically. In this paper, we study the effects of extra dimensions on the conversion probability between photon and ALPs. The conversion probability saturates and may reach almost $100\\%$ for high energy photons. We show that the size of extra dimension affects the energy at which saturation occurs. The observations of high-energy photons may support the possibility of smaller extra dimension.",

It has been pointed out by Caron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from the phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via unitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that the phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by performing a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to calculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of this method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form factor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.",

The description of the hadronic phase space and the invariant amplitude formalism, earlier developed for the neutral pion channel, are applied here. Some modifications are required to fulfill the invariance and to account for an additional contribution due to diagram with the pion pole. Two different variants which lead to dipole and monopole asymptotic behaviour of the pion electromagnetic form factor, are considered. The double and single distributions over the invariant variables as well the total cross section, are obtained. The results are plotted for $s=$5,\\,6,\\,10,\\,16\\, GeV$^2$. The calculations are performed for the $œÄ^-\\,p\\,\\bar{n}$ channel and the rules to proceed to the $œÄ^+\\,n\\,\\bar{p}$ channel are formulated for every distribution.",

        "Authors": "Ankita Kakoti, Mrinal Kumar Das",
        "Abstract": "Left Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) being an extension of the Standard model of particle physics incorporates within itself Type-I and Type-II seesaw mass terms naturally. Both the mass terms can have significant amount of contribution to the resulting light neutrino mass within the model and hence on the different phenomenology associated within. In this paper, we have thoroughly analyzed and discussed the implications of specifying different weightages to the type-I and type-II mass terms and also the study has been carried out for different values of $M_{W_R}$ which is mass of the right-handed gauge boson. This paper also gives a deeper insight into the new physics contributions of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay $(0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤)$ and their variations with the net baryon asymmetry arising out of the model. Therefore, the main objective of the present paper rests on investigating the implications of imposing different weightage to the type-I and type-II seesaw terms and different values of $M_{W_R}$ on the new physics contributions of $0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤$ and net baryon asymmetry arising out as a result of resonant leptogenesis. LRSM in this work has been realized using modular group of level 3, $Œì(3)$ which is isomorphic to non-abelian discrete symmetry group $A_4$, the advantage being the non-requirement of flavons within the model and hence maintaining the minimality of the model.",

        "Abstract": "The delensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps will be increasingly valuable for extracting as much information as possible from future CMB surveys. Delensing provides many general benefits, including sharpening of the acoustic peaks, more accurate recovery of the damping tail, and reduction of lensing-induced $B$-mode power. In this paper we present several applications of delensing focused on testing theories of early-universe inflation with observations of the CMB. We find that delensing the CMB results in improved parameter constraints for reconstructing the spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations, probing oscillatory features in the primordial curvature spectrum, measuring the spatial curvature of the universe, and constraining several different models of isocurvature perturbations. In some cases we find that delensing can recover almost all of the constraining power contained in unlensed spectra, and it will be a particularly valuable analysis technique to achieve further improvements in constraints for model parameters whose measurements are not expected to improve significantly when utilizing only lensed CMB maps from next-generation CMB surveys. We also quantify the prospects of testing the single-field inflation tensor consistency condition using delensed CMB data; we find it to be out of reach of current and proposed experimental technology and advocate for alternative detection methods.",

        "Authors": "Pouya Asadi, Aria Radick, Tien-Tien Yu",
        "Abstract": "We study a Lepton-Flavored Dark Matter model and its signatures at a future Muon Collider. We focus on the less-explored regime of feeble dark matter interactions, which suppresses the dangerous lepton-flavor violating processes, gives rise to dark matter freeze-in production, and leads to long-lived particle signatures at colliders. We find that the interplay of dark matter freeze-in and its mediator freeze-out gives rise to an upper bound of around TeV scales on the dark matter mass. The signatures of this model depend on the lifetime of the mediator, and can range from generic prompt decays to more exotic long-lived particle signals. In the prompt region, we calculate the signal yield, study useful kinematics cuts, and report tolerable systematics that would allow for a $5œÉ$ discovery. In the long-lived region, we calculate the number of charged tracks and displaced lepton signals of our model in different parts of the detector, and uncover kinematic features that can be used for background rejection. We show that, unlike in hadron colliders, multiple production channels contribute significantly which leads to sharply distinct kinematics for electroweakly-charged long-lived particle signals. Ultimately, the collider signatures of this lepton-flavored dark matter model are common amongst models of electroweak-charged new physics, rendering this model a useful and broadly applicable benchmark model for future Muon Collider studies that can help inform work on detector design and studies of systematics.",

The $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry provides a UV completion by naturally accommodating three right handed neutrinos from anomaly cancellation requirements which, in combination with the left handed neutrinos, form the sub-eV Dirac neutrinos after electroweak symmetry breaking. The particle content and the gauge charges are chosen in such a way that light neutrinos remain purely Dirac and dark matter, a gauge singlet Dirac fermion, remain stable. We consider both thermal and non-thermal production possibilities of dark matter and correlate the corresponding parameter space with the one within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments sensitive to enhanced relativistic degrees of freedom $ŒîN_{\\rm eff}$. The interplay of dark matter, CMB, structure formation and other terrestrial constraints keep the scenario very predictive leading the $U(1)_{B-L}$ parameter space into tight corners.",

We use Cassini data on ionospheric $H_3^+$ emission collected 3 hours either side of Jovian midnight, during its flyby in 2000, and set novel constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-38}$ cm$^2$.

We start by reviewing the approach based on soft-collinear effective field theory and show that the standard factorization into short distance coefficients, collinear and soft functions at NLP leads in general to the appearance of endpoint divergences, which prevent the naive application of resummation techniques based on the renormalization group. Taking thrust as a case study, we then show that these singularities are indeed an artifact of the effective theory, and discuss how they can be removed to recover a finite factorization theorem and achieve resummation at NLP, at LL accuracy. Last, we discuss recent work concerning the calculation of all collinear and soft functions necessary to reproduce Drell-Yan near threshold up to NNLO in perturbation theory. This calculation provides useful data to extend resummation at NLP beyond LL accuracy.",

Like in the case of dark matter scattering on nuclei, electron-recoil-based searches also face an ultimate background in the form of neutrinos. The so-called \"neutrino fog'' refers to the range of open dark-matter parameter space where the background of neutrinos can potentially prevent a conclusive discovery claim of a dark matter signal from being made. In this study, we map the neutrino fog for a range of electron recoil experiments based on silicon, germanium, xenon and argon targets. In analogy to the nuclear recoil case, we also calculate the \"edge'' to the neutrino fog, which can be used as a visual guide to where neutrinos become an important background -- this boundary excludes some parts of the key theory milestones used to motivate these experiments.",

The components of these complex directional vectors in the Euclidean space can be mapped directly to the rapidities of the Minkowski space soft function. We present the results of the one-loop calculation of the Euclidean space analog to the soft function using these complex directional vectors. As a result, we show that the calculation is valid only when the directional vectors obey the relation: $|r| = |n^3/n^0| > 1$, and that this result corresponds to a computation in Minkowski space with space-like directed Wilson lines. Finally, we show that a lattice calculable object can be constructed that has the desired properties of the soft function.",

We employ persistent homology to infer topological features of the nonequilibrium many-body system for different numbers of field components $N$ via a hierarchy of cubical complexes. Specifically, we show that the persistent homology of local energy density fluctuations can give rise to signatures of self-similar scaling associated with topological defects, distinct from the scaling behaviour of nonlinear wave modes. This contributes to the systematic understanding of the role of topological defects for far-from-equilibrium time evolutions of nonlinear many-body systems.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, an unquenched quark model is proposed for describing the heavy-light mesons by taking into account the coupled-channel effects induced by chiral dynamics. After including a relativistic correction term for the strong transition amplitudes, both the mass spectra and decay widths of the observed heavy-light mesons can be successfully described simultaneously in a unified framework, several long-standing puzzles related to the small masses and broad widths are overcome naturally. We also provide valuable guidance in searching new heavy-light mesons by the detailed predictions of their masses, widths, and branching ratios. The success of the unquenched quark model presented in this work indicates it may be an important step for understanding the hadron spectrum.",

        "Abstract": "The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group U(1)$_{\\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark-matter candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out these dark-matter models.",

        "Abstract": "Type-II seesaw leptogenesis is a model that integrates inflation, baryon number asymmetry, and neutrino mass simultaneously. It employs the Affleck-Dine mechanism to generate lepton asymmetry, with the Higgs bosons serving as the inflaton. Previous studies assumed inflation to occur in a valley of the potential, employing the single-field approximation. In this work, we explore an alternative scenario for the type-II seesaw leptogenesis, where the inflation takes place along a ridge of the potential. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive numerical calculation in the canonical scenario, where inflation occurs in a valley, confirming the effectiveness of the single-field approximation. Then, we introduce a novel scenario wherein inflation initiates along the potential's ridge and transitions to the valley in the late stages. In this case, the single-field inflation approximation is no longer valid, yet leptogenesis is still successfully achieved. We find that this scenario can generate a significant non-Gaussianity signature, offering testable predictions for future experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The Scalar Field Dark Matter model has been known in various ways throughout its history; Fuzzy, BEC, Wave, Ultralight, Axion-like Dark Matter, etc. All of them consist in proposing that the dark matter of the universe is a spinless field $Œ¶$ that follows the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation of motion $\\BoxŒ¶-dV/dŒ¶=0$, for a given scalar field potential $V$. The difference between different models is sometimes the choice of the scalar field potential $V$. In the literature we find that people usually work in the nonrelativistic, weak-field limit of the KG equation where it transforms into the Schr√∂dinger equation and the Einstein equations into the Poisson equation, reducing the KG-Einstein system, to the Schr√∂dinger-Poisson system. In this paper, we review some of the most interesting achievements of this model from the historical point of view and its comparison with observations, showing that this model could be the last answer to the question about the nature of dark matter in the universe.",

Such signals can be a consequence of new lepton-number violating or lepton-number conserving interactions, with their interpretations depending on the Majorana versus Dirac nature of the neutrinos. Furthermore, the possible existence of new massive sterile neutrinos can be tested via their distinctive imprints in the invariant mass spectrum. Within the model-independent framework of the weak effective theory at dimension-six, we study the New Physics effects of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos on the differential distribution of $K^+\\rightarrow œÄ^+ŒΩ\\barŒΩ$ allowing for lepton-number violating interactions and potential new sterile neutrinos. We determine the current and expected future sensitivity on the corresponding Wilson coefficients using the distribution measured by the NA62 collaboration and accounting for expected improvements based on the HIKE experiment. We present single-operator fits and also determine correlations among different type of operators. Even though we focus on $s\\to dŒΩŒΩ$ transitions, the operator bases for Majorana and Dirac and the classification of lepton-number-violating/conserving interactions is applicable also for the study of $b\\to s/dŒΩŒΩ$ and $c\\to uŒΩŒΩ$ transitions relevant in current phenomenology.",

        "Authors": "Ioanna Stamou, Sebastien Clesse",
        "Abstract": "We investigate the viability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the Standard Model (SM) in a scenario that does not rely on specific inflationary features or any exotic physics such as phase transitions or non-minimal coupling to gravity. If the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field lies exactly at the transition between metastability and stability, its potential exhibits an inflexion point due to radiative corrections. The BEH can act like a stochastic curvaton field, leading to a non-Gaussian tail of large curvature fluctuations that later collapse into PBHs when they re-enter inside the horizon. This scenario would require a precise value of the top-quark mas to ensure the Higgs stability, which is disfavored but still consistent with the most recent measurements. However, we also find that large curvature fluctuations are also generated on cosmological scales that are inconsistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We therefore conclude that the SM cannot have led to the formation of PBHs based on this mechanism. Nevertheless, a variation of the scenario based on the Palatini formulation of gravity may have provided the conditions to produce stellar-mass PBHs with an abundance comparable to dark matter, without producing too large curvature fluctuations on cosmological scales.",

Motivated by these studies, we review in this paper an improved perturbative QCD expansion, defined some time ago, which also exploits the renormalons by means of a suitable conformal mapping of the Borel plane. In particular, we revisit the convergence of the new expansion, by completing the proof presented in a previous paper and showing that the domain of convergence is larger than stated before. We also check the validity of the convergence conditions for the Adler function and the CI and FO expansions of the $œÑ$ hadronic spectral function moments, and compare the approach based on conformal mapping with recent solutions to the CIPT-FOPT discrepancy proposed in the literature.",

Subsequent to the symmetry breaking, the dark photon dynamically acquires mass via the Higgs mechanism, potentially contributing to the dark matter abundance.

        "Abstract": "The flavor composition of TeV--PeV astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the proportion of neutrinos of different flavors in their flux, is a versatile probe of high-energy astrophysics and fundamental physics. Because flavor identification is challenging and the number of detected high-energy astrophysical neutrinos is limited, so far measurements of the flavor composition have represented an average over the range of observed neutrino energies. Yet, this washes out the potential existence of changes in the flavor composition with energy and weakens our sensitivity to the many models that posit them. For the first time, we measure the energy dependence of the flavor composition, looking for a transition from low to high energies. Our present-day measurements, based on the 7.5-year public sample of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events (HESE), find no evidence of a flavor transition. The observation of HESE and through-going muons jointly by next-generation neutrino telescopes Baikal-GVD, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, P-ONE, TAMBO, and TRIDENT may identify a flavor transition around 200TeV by 2030. By 2040, we could infer the flavor composition with which neutrinos are produced with enough precision to establish the transition from neutrino production via the full pion decay chain at low energies to muon-damped pion decay at high energies.",

The contact is made through the identification of the Dirac-like Hamiltonian resulting from the SME with that corresponding to the WSM in the linearized tight-binding approximation. We first calculate the effective action by computing the non-perturbative vacuum polarization tensor using thermal field theory techniques, focusing upon the corrections at finite chemical potential and zero temperature. Next, we confirm our results by a direct calculation of the anomalous Hall current within a chiral kinetic theory approach.\n  In an ideal Dirac cone picture of the WSM (isotropic and non-tilted) such response is known to be governed by axion electrodynamics, with the space-time dependent axion angle $Œò(\\mathbf{r},t) = 2 (\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - b _{0} t)$, being $2 \\mathbf{b}$ and $2b _{0}$ the separation of the Weyl nodes in momentum and energy, respectively. In this paper we demonstrate that the node tilting and the anisotropies induce novel corrections at a finite density which however preserve the structure of the axionic field theory. We apply our results to the ideal Weyl semimetal $\\mathrm{EuCd}_{2}\\mathrm{As}_{2}$ and to the highly anisotropic and tilted monopnictide $\\mathrm{TaAs}$.",

The muon collider can cover most of the kinematically allowed mass range and can measure the coupling g_œÅto percent level. For the fermionic resonances (i.e. the top partners), pair production easily covers the resonance mass below 5 TeV, while single production extends the reach to 6 TeV for a small Œæ= 0.015.",

The self interaction potential is taken to be either quartic, $ŒªœÜ^4/4!$, or quartic plus cubic, $ŒªœÜ^4/4!+Œ≤œÜ^3/3!$ ($Œª\\,{\\ensuremath >}\\,0$). We compute the four and three point vertex functions up to two loop. The purely local or partly local part of these renormalised loop corrected vertex functions grow unboundedly after sufficient number of de Sitter $e$-foldings, due to the appearances of secular logarithms. We focus on the purely local part of the vertex functions and attempt a resummation of them in terms of the dynamically generated mass of the scalar field at late times. It turns out that the resummed, non-perturbative effective vertex functions have values less than that of the tree level. The variation of these vertex functions are investigated with respect to the tree level couplings numerically. Since neither the secular effect, nor the dynamical generation of field mass is possible in the Minkowski spacetime, the above phenomenon has no flat spacetime analogue.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for state transfer under trace-preserving transformations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT). Under these free transformations, we show that logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

While this common feature can be taken as a hint towards holography on de Sitter space, understanding the representation theory has importance for cosmological applications where de Sitter spacetime is relevant. Among the categories of $SO(d+1,1)$ unitary irreducible representations, discrete series is important in physical applications because they are expected to capture gauge fields. However, they are also the most difficult ones to recognize in field theoretical examples compared to representations from the other categories. Here we point towards some examples where we are able to recognize discrete series representations from fields on de Sitter and highlight some of the properties of these representations.",

Indeed it is demonstrated that C-metrics can be obtained as a limit of a binary system where one of the black holes grows indefinitely large, becoming a Rindler horizon. When the bigger black hole, before the limiting process, is of Schwarzschild type we recover usual accelerating black holes belonging to the Plebanski-Demianski class, thus type D. Whether the greater black hole carries some extra features, such as electric charges or rotations, we get generalised accelerating black holes which belongs to a more general class, the type I. In that case the background has a richer structure, reminiscent of the physical features of the inflated companion, with respect to the standard Rindler spacetime.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we analyse the pole-skipping phenomena of finite temperature Yang-Mills theory with quark flavors which is dual to D3-D7 brane system in the bulk. We also consider the external electric field in the boundary field theory which is dual to the world volume electric field on the D7 brane. We will work in the probe limit where the D7 branes do not back-react to the D3 brane background. In this scenario, we decode the characteristic parameters of the chaos namely, Lyapunov exponent $Œª_{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_b$ from the pole-skipping points by performing the near-horizon analysis of the linearised Einstein equations. Unlike pure Yang-Mills, once charged quarks with a background electric field are added into the system, the characteristic parameters of the chaos show non-trivial dependence on the quark mass and external electric field. We have observed that $Œª_{L}$ and $v_b$ decreases with increasing electric field. This suggests the existence of a critical electric field at which chaos parameters vanish. In the presence of a strong electric field, therefore, the dual system of Yang-Mills gauge fields along with dissociated quarks shows non-chaotic behaviour. We further perform the pole-skipping analysis for the gauge invariant sound, shear, and tensor modes of the perturbation in the bulk and discuss their physical importance in the holographic context.",

Interesting properties and phenomena have been discovered, involving stability, forces, collisions and swapping of charge between different components of multi-Q-ball systems. We investigate these phenomena in quantum field theory, including quantum corrections to leading order in a 2PI coupling expansion, the inhomogeneous Hartree approximation. The presence of quantum modes and new decay channels allows the mean-field Q-ball to exchange charge with the quantum modes, and also alters the charge swapping frequencies of the composite Q-balls. It is also observed that the periodic exchanges between the mean-field and quantum modes tend to be quenched by collisions between Q-balls. We illustrate how the classical limit arises through a scaling of the Q-ball potential, making quantum corrections negligible for large-amplitude Q-balls.",

Generic features of string theory setups (such as high scale supersymmetry breaking and epochs of early matter domination driven by string moduli) can accommodate superheavy dark matter with the correct relic abundance. In addition, stringy instantons induce tiny $R$-parity violating couplings which make dark matter unstable with a lifetime well above the age of the Universe. Adopting a model-independent approach, we compute the flux and spectrum of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos from three-body decays of superheavy dark matter and constrain its mass-lifetime plane with current observations and future experiments. We show that these bounds have only a mild dependence on the exact nature of neutralino dark matter and its decay channels. Applying these constraints to an explicit string model sets an upper bound of ${\\cal O}(0.1)$ on the string coupling, ensuring that the effective field theory is in the perturbative regime.",

These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R√©nyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.",

In recent years, it has been observed that the rational functions in multi-loop calculations greatly simplify under partial fractioning. In this article, we present a technique to reconstruct rational functions directly in partial-fractioned form, by evaluating the functions at special integer points chosen for their properties under a p-adic metric. As an application, we apply this technique to reconstruct the largest rational function in the integration-by-parts reduction of one of the rank-5 integrals appearing in 2-loop 5-point full-colour massless QCD amplitude calculations. The number of required numerical probes (per prime field) is found to be around 25 times smaller than in conventional techniques, and the obtained result is 130 times smaller. The reconstructed result displays signs of additional structure that could be used to further reduce its size and the number of required probes.",

We study how the chiral algebra arises from the worldsheet perspective. In the worldsheet CFT dual of 4D N=4 SYM at the free point, we extract the subsector that corresponds to the spacetime Schur operators at generic coupling, and show how they generate the chiral algebra. The result can be easily generalized to 4D N=2 superconformal field theories that arise as orbifolds of 4D N=4 SYM.",

We propose and develop a complementary version of this conjecture: quantum chaotic systems display a Lanczos spectrum whose local means and covariances are well described by RMT. To support this proposal, we first demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems. We then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and covariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time behavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor, as well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with continuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time averages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean Lanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the statistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum chaos. Finally, we clarify the relation between spread complexity and the universality classes of RMT by exploring various values of the Dyson index and Poisson distributed spectra.",

        "Abstract": "Generalised Complex Geometry provides a natural interpretation of the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry conditions for warped solutions of type II supergravity as differential equations on polyforms on the internal manifold. Written in this language the supersymmetry conditions correspond to calibration conditions for probe D-branes: D-string, domain-wall or space-filling branes, depending on the directions they span in the non-compact four-dimensional space. The BPS condition corresponding to the calibration of space-filling D-branes has been reformulated by Tomasiello, eliminating the explicit dependence on the metric. We generalise this derivation to the case of non-supersymmetric backgrounds violating the domain-wall and D-string calibration conditions. We use this reformulation to derive constraints that the ten-dimensional solutions with BPS space-filling sources must respect in order to dimensionally reduce to solutions of four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity with non-vanishing F-terms and potentially non-vanishing D-terms. We give the equations of motion for the class of type II vacua satisfying these constraints in the language of pure spinors. We investigate how restrictive these constraints are for the class of type IIB SU$(3)$ backgrounds with BPS space-filling O5-planes.",

To achieve this, it is necessary to compute not only the functional determinant of the fluctuation operator in the background of the classical bounce but also its functional derivative evaluated at the classical bounce. The former is efficiently calculated using the Gel'fand-Yaglom method. We illustrate how the latter can also be calculated with the same method, combined with a computation of various Green's functions.",

        "Abstract": "While the robustness of Hawking radiation in the presence of UV Lorentz breaking is well-established, the Unruh effect has posed a challenge, with a large literature concluding that even the low-energy restoration of Lorentz invariance may not be sufficient to sustain this phenomenon. Notably, these previous studies have primarily focused on Lorentz-breaking matter on a conventional Rindler wedge. In this work, we demonstrate that considering the complete structure of Lorentz-breaking gravity, specifically the presence of a hypersurface orthogonal aether field, leads to the selection of a new Rindler wedge configuration characterized by a uniformly accelerated aether flow. This uniform acceleration provides a reference scale for comparison with the Lorentz-breaking one, thus ensuring the persistence of the Unruh effect in this context. We establish this by calculating the expected temperature using a Bogolubov approach, and by analyzing the response of a uniformly accelerated detector. We suggest that this resilience of the Unruh effect opens interesting possibilities towards future developments for using it as a tool to constrain Lorentz breaking theories of gravity.",

This suggests that the study of the ``subadditivity cone'', and the set of its extreme rays realizable in quantum mechanics, provides a powerful new tool for deriving inner bounds for the quantum and stabilizer entropy cones, as well as constraints on new inequalities for the von Neumann entropy.",

Our reformulation of earlier constructions of coactions and single-valued polylogarithms preserves choices of fibration bases, exposes the correlation between multiple zeta values of different depths and paves the way for generalizations beyond genus zero.",

Initially devised to introduce primary hair in spherically symmetric solutions within General Relativity in any dimension, our investigation also explores the conditions under which spherically symmetric black holes in alternative gravitational theories become amenable to the endorsement of primary hair through a similar pattern. As a preliminary exploration, we embark on the process of endorsing primary hair to the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole.

The completion of the transition is ensured by a non-minimal coupling between gravity and the order parameter and fast reheating occurs thanks to a preheating phase.

        "Authors": "A. A. Saharian",
        "Abstract": "This paper reviews the investigations on the vacuum expectation value of the current density for a charged scalar field in spacetimes with toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. As background geometries locally Minkowskian (LM), locally de Sitter (LdS) and locally anti-de Sitter (LAdS) spacetimes are considered. Along compact dimensions quasiperiodicity conditions are imposed on the field operator and the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. The vacuum current has non-zero components only along compact dimensions. Those components are periodic functions of the magnetic flux enclosed by compact dimensions with the period equal to the flux quantum. For LdS and LAdS geometries and for small values of the length of a compact dimension, compared with the curvature radius, the leading term in the expansion of the the vacuum current along that dimension coincides with that for LM bulk. In this limit the dominant contribution to the mode sum for the current density comes from the vacuum fluctuations with wavelength smaller than the curvature radius and the influence of the gravitational field is weak. The effects of the gravitational field are essential for lengths of compact dimensions larger than the curvature radius. In particular, instead of the exponential suppression of the current density in LM bulk one can have power law decay in LdS and LAdS spacetimes.",

The density matrix is derived for the weak decay of a polarized muon at rest, $Œº^- \\rightarrow ŒΩ_Œº (e^- \\bar ŒΩ_e)$, with Lorentz invariant density matrix entries and unitarity upheld at tree level. The electron's von Neumann entanglement entropy distributions are calculated with respect to both the electron's emission angle and energy. The angular entropy distribution favors an electron emitted backwards with respect to the muon's polarization given a minimum volume regularization. The kinematic entropy distribution is maximal at half the muon's rest mass energy. These results are similar to the electron's angular and kinematic decay rate distributions. Both the density matrix and entanglement entropy can be cast either in terms of ratios of areas or volumes.",

With this new formalism the influence of the background rotation on the color deconfinement transition for a SU(2) pure gluon system. The KvBLL caloron, which is a color neutral and asymptotically nontrivial solution of Yang-Mills equation at finite temperature, is adopted to confine the color charges. With new solutions of the caloron's constituent particles, i.e. dyons, the semi-classical potential, which confines color charges, and the perturbative potential, induced by the Gaussian fluctuation, have been obtained for this system under rotation. By solving the critical temperature of confinement-deconfinement phase transition in different computation schemes, it is found that neither the rotational semi-classical potential nor Gaussian fluctuations can confine color charges more tightly when the rotation becomes faster. While only a stronger coupling constant is able to make the critical temperature increasing with angular velocity, as that indicated in lattice simulations. And it is also found with some particular sets of parameters, a non-monotonic dependence of the critical temperature will be obtained in the most physically realistic case, in which all the three factors are taken into account.",

        "Abstract": "We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $IN^2$ on curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between vector fields and inflaton $I$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore the regime where $I\\gg 1$, a realm that has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.",

        "Abstract": "We study relative differential and integral forms and their cohomology on families of supermanifolds, and prove a relative version of Poincar√© duality relating the cohomology of differential and integral forms in different geometric categories. In the algebraic category, this is a byproduct of Grothendieck-Verdier duality. In the smooth category, we complement Poincar√© duality by proving the compactly supported Poincar√© lemmas for both differential and integral forms, filling a gap in the literature. In the relevant case of integral forms, this makes apparent the algebraic nature of the Berezin integration in the odd directions. We then use our results to study supergravity. In particular, we describe supergravity in dimension three via higher Cartan structures, which can be regarded as certain classes of connections taking values in $L_\\infty$-superalgebras. We then use relative Poincar√© duality to state a general form of the action principle in a mathematically rigorous manner. This interpolates in a unified fashion between two equivalent formulations of supergravity, one based on the superspace approach and the other on the group manifold approach in the physics literature.",

        "Abstract": "In this note, we review some new results we recently obtained about the infrared physics of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with a unitary gauge group, in particular in the presence of a non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter and with generic values of the Chern-Simons levels. We review the 3d GLSM (also known as 3d A-model) approach to the computation of the 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ twisted chiral ring of half-BPS lines. For particular values of the Chern-Simons levels, this twisted chiral ring has a neat interpretation in terms of the quantum K-theory (QK) of the Grassmannian manifold. We propose a new set of line defects of the 3d gauge theory, dubbed Grothendieck lines, which represent equivariant Schubert classes in the QK ring. In particular, we show that double Grothendieck polynomials, which represent the equivariant Chern characters of the Schubert classes, arise physically as Witten indices of certain quiver supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We also explain two distinct ways how to compute K-theoretic enumerative invariants using the 3d GLSM approach. \\textit{This review article is a contribution to the proceedings of the GLSM@30 conference, which was held in May 2023 at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics.}",

        "Authors": "Ana Alonso-Serrano, Sebastian Schuster, Matt Visser",
        "Abstract": "Entertaining the possibility of time travel will invariably challenge dearly held concepts of fundamental physics. It becomes relatively easy to construct multiple logical contradictions using differing starting points from various well-established fields of physics. Sometimes, the interpretation is that only a full theory of quantum gravity will be able to settle these logical contradictions. Even then, it remains unclear if the multitude of problems could be overcome. Yet as definitive as this seems to the notion of time travel in physics, such a recourse to quantum gravity comes with its own, long-standing challenge to most of these counter-arguments to time travel: These arguments rely on time, while quantum gravity is (in)famously stuck with and dealing with the problem of time. One attempt to answer this problem within the canonical framework resulted in the Page-Wootters formalism, and its recent gauge-theoretic re-interpretation - as an emergent notion of time. Herein, we will begin a programme to study toy models implementing the Hamiltonian constraint in quantum theory, with an aim towards understanding what an emergent notion of time can tell us about the (im)possibility of time travel.",

The braiding property is encoded in a $t$-dependent $4\\times 4$ braiding matrix $B_t$ related to the Alexander-Conway polynomial. The nonvanishing complex parameter t defines the braided parastatistics. At $t = 1$ ordinary fermions are recovered. The values of $t$ at roots of unity are organized into levels which specify the maximal number of braided Majorana fermions in a multiparticle sector. Generic values of $t$ and the $t =-1$ root of unity mimick the behaviour of ordinary bosons.",

        "Abstract": "The effect of the noise induced by gravitons in the case of a freely falling particle from the viewpoint of an external observer has been recently calculated in \\href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.066024}{Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 066024}. There the authors have calculated the quantum gravity modified Newton's law of free fall where the spacetime has been considered to be weakly curved. In our work, we extend this work by calculating the variance of the velocity and eventually the momentum of the freely falling massive particle. From this simple calculation, we observe that the product of the standard deviation in the position with that of the standard deviation in momentum picks up a higher order correction which is proportional to the square of the standard deviation in momentum. We also find out that in the Planck limit (both Planck length and Planck mass), this uncertainty product gives the well-known form of the generalized uncertainty principle. We then calculate a similar uncertainty product when the graviton is in a squeezed state, and eventually, we get back the same uncertainty product. Finally, we extend our analysis for the gravitons being in a thermal state and obtain a temperature-dependent uncertainty product. If one replaces this temperature with the Planck temperature and the mass of the particle by the Planck mass, the usual uncertainty product appears once again. We also obtain an upper bound of the uncertainty product thereby giving a range of the product of the variances in position and momentum.",

We observe that the configurations cluster in two-dimensional latent layers of the autoencoder models and analyze which physical quantities are relevant to the clustering. As a result, it is found that tadpole charges of hidden D6-branes characterize the clustering. We expect that there is another important factor because a checkerboard pattern in two-dimensional latent layers is observed in the clustering.",

We show that accretion imprints time-dependent frequencies and amplitude to a ringdown waveform, and we show how to model accurately this effect in certain regimes. We also comment on the direct emission of gravitational waves due to perturbations in the in--falling matter, which is of relevance for black holes embedded in astrophysical environments.",

We construct a general geometric description of the cuscuton field theory by introducing curvature corrections to both the volume (potential) and the surface (kinetic) terms in the original cuscuton action. Our assumptions involve a stack of spacelike branes, separated by 4-dimensional bulks. We conjecture that the cuscuton, initially a discrete field, becomes continuous in the limit, there are many such transitions. From this we derive an effective action for the cuscuton theory and show that at the quadratic level our theory propagates only the two tensorial degrees of freedom.",

A few applications on the renormalization properties of popular effective field theories showcase the strength of the proposed approach, which drastically reduces the complexity of standard loop calculations. Our results provide a powerful tool to interpret experimental measurements of low-energy observables, such as flavor violating processes or electric and magnetic dipole moments, as induced by new physics emerging above the electroweak scale.",

We broaden the scope by considering the field in any quasi-free state, which includes vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states. A key aspect of our method is the instantaneous interaction between the detector and the field, which enables a thorough non-perturbative analysis. We demonstrate that the detector can successfully extract positive work from the quantum Otto cycle, even when two isochoric processes occur instantaneously, provided the detector in the second isochoric process receives a signal from the first interaction. This signaling allows the detector to release heat into the field, thereby the thermodynamic cycle is completed. As a demonstration, we consider a detector at rest in flat spacetime and compute the work extracted from the Minkowski vacuum state.",

We show that the initial entangled states become disentangled at large space-like distances. This does not contradict the violation of Bell inequalities observed at small distances between detectors. We propose an experiment to study the dependence of the quantum correlation function and Bell value on increasing distance between detectors.

Our analysis focuses on correlations emerging at finite temperature, achieved through the computation of entanglement measures. Our approach relies on characterizing correlation functions of twist fields using BCFT techniques. We provide non-perturbative predictions for the crossover between low and high temperatures. An intriguing interplay between bulk and boundary effects, associated with the bulk/boundary scaling dimensions of the fields above, is found. In particular, the entanglement entropy is primarily influenced by bulk thermal fluctuations, exhibiting extensiveness for large system sizes with a prefactor independent of the scattering properties of the defect. In contrast, negativity is governed by fluctuations across the entangling points only, adhering to an area law; its value depends non-trivially on the defect, and it diverges logarithmically as the temperature is decreased. To validate our predictions, we numerically check them for free fermions on the lattice, finding good agreement.",

We show that the $N\\to\\infty$ limit of the OTOC $\\langle [A(t),B]^2\\rangle$ is explicitly given by a suitable symplectic Bogoliubov dynamics.

In such a way, we can obtain numerous exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations. We apply this methodology to the classical parabolic differential equation (the wave equation), to the classical hyperbolic differential equation (the heat equation), and to the classical elliptic differential equation (Laplace equation). In addition, we use the methodology to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations by means of the solutions of linear differential equations and by means of the solutions of the nonlinear differential equations of Bernoulli and Riccati. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of the methodology to lead to exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations on the basis of known solutions of other nonlinear partial differential equations. As an example of this, we use the Korteweg--de Vries equation and its solutions. Traveling wave solutions of nonlinear differential equations are of special interest in this article. We demonstrate the existence of the following phenomena described by some of the obtained solutions: (i) occurrence of the solitary wave--solitary antiwave from the solution, which is zero at the initial moment (analogy of an occurrence of particle and antiparticle from the vacuum); (ii) splitting of a nonlinear solitary wave into two solitary waves (analogy of splitting of a particle into two particles); (iii) soliton behavior of some of the obtained waves; (iv) existence of solitons which move with the same velocity despite the different shape and amplitude of the solitons.",

        "Abstract": "Loop Vertex Expansion (LVE) was developed to construct QFT models with local and non-local interactions. Using LVE, one can prove the analyticity in the finite cardioid-like domain in the complex plain of the coupling constant of the free energies and cumulants of various vector, matrix, or tensor-type models. Here, applying the idea of choosing the initial approximation depending on the coupling constant, we construct the analytic continuation of the free energy of the quartic matrix model beyond the standard LVE cardioid over the branch cut and for arbitrary large couplings.",

        "Abstract": "We consider the problem of local correlations in the kicked, dual-unitary coupled maps on D-dimensional lattices. We demonstrate that for D>=2, fully dual-unitary systems exhibit ultra-local correlations: the correlations between any pair of operators with local support vanish in a finite number of time steps. In addition, for $D=2$, we consider the partially dual-unitary regime of the model, where the dual-unitarity applies to only one of the two spatial directions. For this case, we show that correlations generically decay exponentially and provide an explicit formula for the correlation function between the operators supported on two and four neighbouring sites.",

        "Authors": "Mihailo Stojnic",
        "Abstract": "Relying on a recent progress made in studying bilinearly indexed (bli) random processes in \\cite{Stojnicnflgscompyx23,Stojnicsflgscompyx23}, the main foundational principles of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) were established in \\cite{Stojnicflrdt23}. We here study famous Hopfield models and show that their statistical behavior can be characterized via the fl RDT. Due to a nestedly lifted nature, the resulting characterizations and, therefore, the whole analytical machinery that produces them, become fully operational only if one can successfully conduct underlying numerical evaluations. After conducting such evaluations for both positive and negative Hopfield models, we observe a remarkably fast convergence of the fl RDT mechanism. Namely, for the so-called square case, the fourth decimal precision is achieved already on the third (second non-trivial) level of lifting (3-sfl RDT) for the positive and on the fourth (third non-trivial) level of lifting (4-sfl RDT) for the corresponding negative model. In particular, we obtain the scaled ground state free energy $\\approx 1.7788$ for the positive and $\\approx 0.3279$ for the negative model.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a new strategy to implement the free-energy based wetting boundary condition within the phase-field lattice Boltzmann method. The greatest advantage of the proposed method is that the implementation of contact line motion can be significantly simplified while still maintaining good accuracy. For this purpose, the liquid-solid free energy is treated as a part of the chemical potential instead of the boundary condition, thus avoiding complicated interpolations with irregular geometries. Several numerical testing cases including the droplet spreading processes on the idea flat, inclined and curved boundaries are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method has good ability and satisfactory accuracy to simulate contact line motions.",

We then develop various techniques to determine the wave function at such rational points. Finally, we illustrate our conjectures and obtain explicit results in the examples of the figure-eight and the three-twist knots. In the case of the figure-eight knot, we also perform a direct evaluation of the state integral in the rational case and observe that the resulting wave function has the features of the ground state for a quantum mirror curve.",

We present a unified and general mathematical theory, encompassing all particular cases that we had already addressed, and we fill important analytic and algebraic gaps in the literature on the ODE/IM correspondence. For every affine Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ -- whose Langlands dual $\\mathfrak{g}'$ is the untwisted affinisation of a simple Lie algebra -- we study a class of affine twisted parabolic Miura $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers, introduced by Feigin, Frenkel and Hernandez. The Feigin-Frenkel-Hernandez opers are defined by fixing the singularity structure at $0$ and $\\infty$, and by allowing a finite number of additional singular terms with trivial monodromy. We define the central connection matrix and Stokes matrix for these opers, and prove that the coefficients of the former satisfy the the $QQ$ system of the quantum $\\mathfrak{g}'$-Drinfeld-Sokolov (or quantum $\\mathfrak{g}'$-KdV) model. If $\\mathfrak{g}$ is untwisted, it is known that the trivial monodromy conditions are equivalent to a complete system of algebraic equations for the additional singularities. We prove a suprising negative result in the case $\\mathfrak{g}$ is twisted: in this case, the trivial monodromy conditions have no non-trivial solutions.",

Finally, we prove the existence of an optimal shape maximizing the heat energy transfer in a class of ($Œµ$, $\\infty$)-domains, allowing fractal boundaries, while that optimum can generally not be reached in the class of Lipschitz domains.",

        "Abstract": "The stability of two-dimensional buoyancy-driven convection in a vertical porous slot, wherein a plane Couette flow is additionally present, is studied. This complex fluid flow scenario is examined under the influence of Robin-type boundary conditions, which are applied to perturbations in both velocity and temperature. The inclusion of a time-derivative velocity term within the Darcy momentum equation notably introduces intricacies to the study. The stability of the basic natural convection flow is primarily governed by several key parameters namely, the P√©clet number, the Prandtl-Darcy number, the Biot number and a non-negative parameter that dictates the nature of the vertical boundaries. Through numerical analysis, the stability eigenvalue problem is solved for a variety of combinations of boundary conditions. The outcomes of this analysis reveal the critical threshold values that signify the onset of instability. Furthermore, a detailed examination of the stability of the system has provided insights into both its commonalities and distinctions under different conditions. It is observed that, except for the scenario featuring impermeable-isothermal boundaries, the underlying base flow exhibits instability when subjected to various other configurations of perturbed velocity and temperature boundary conditions. This underscores the notion that the presence of Couette flow alone does not suffice to induce instability within the system. The plots depicting neutral stability curves show either bi-modal or uni-modal characteristics, contingent upon specific parameter values that influence the onset of instability.",

We employ the Micken's methodology to construct a family of explicit nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) methods preserving any given quadratic Lyapunov function $V$, i.e. they admit $V$ as a discrete Lyapunov function. Here, the proposed NSFD methods are derived from a novel non-local approximation for the zero vector function.\n  Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we show that the constructed NSFD methods have the ability to preserve any given quadratic Lyapunov functions regardless of the values of the step size. As an important consequence, they are dynamically consistent with respect to the GAS of continuous-time dynamical systems. On the other hand, the positivity of the proposed NSFD methods is investigated. It is proved that they can also preserve the positivity of solutions of continuous-time dynamical systems.\n  Finally, the theoretical findings are supported by a series of illustrative numerical experiments, in which advantages of the NSFD methods are demonstrated.",

        "Authors": "Clemens S√§mann, Benedict Schinnerl, Roland Steinbauer, Robert ≈†varc",
        "Abstract": "Impulsive gravitational waves are theoretical models of short but violent bursts of gravitational radiation. They are commonly described by two distinct spacetime metrics, one of local Lipschitz regularity, the other one even distributional. These two metrics are thought to be `physically equivalent' since they can be formally related by a `discontinuous coordinate transformation'. In this paper we provide a mathematical analysis of this issue for the entire class of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in a background spacetime of constant curvature. We devise a natural geometric regularisation procedure to show that the notorious change of variables arises as the distributional limit of a family of smooth coordinate transformations. In other words, we establish that both spacetimes arise as distributional limits of a smooth sandwich wave taken in different coordinate systems which are diffeomorphically related.",

This allows us to conclude that the two-species Husimi measure from the solution of $N$-particle Schr√∂dinger equation approximates the solution of the Vlasov equation for two-species systems.",

        "Authors": "Pierre Botteron, Anne Broadbent, Reda Chhaibi, Ion Nechita, Cl√©ment Pellegrini",
        "Abstract": "Communication complexity quantifies how difficult it is for two distant computers to evaluate a function $f(X,Y)$ where the strings $X$ and $Y$ are distributed to the first and second computer, respectively and under the constraint of exchanging as few bits as possible. Surprisingly, some nonlocal boxes, which are resources shared by the two computers, are so powerful that they allow to collapse communication complexity, in the sense that any Boolean function $f$ can be correctly estimated with the exchange of only one bit of communication. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box is an example of such a collapsing resource, but a comprehensive description of the set of collapsing nonlocal boxes remains elusive.\n  In this work, we carry out an algebraic study of the structure of wirings connecting nonlocal boxes, thus defining the notion of the \"product of boxes\" $\\mathtt{P}\\boxtimes\\mathtt{Q}$, and we show related associativity and commutativity results. This gives rise to the notion of the \"orbit of a box\", unveiling surprising geometrical properties about the alignment and parallelism of distilled boxes. The power of this new framework is that it allows to prove previously-reported numerical intuitions concerning the best way to wire consecutive boxes, and to numerically and analytically recover recently-identified noisy PR boxes that collapse communication complexity for different types of noise models.",

        "Abstract": "We present a new holographic duality between q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics and Liouville gravity. The q-Schwarzian is a one parameter deformation of the Schwarzian, which is dual to JT gravity and describes the low energy sector of SYK. We show that the q-Schwarzian in turn is dual to sinh dilaton gravity. This one parameter deformation of JT gravity can be rewritten as Liouville gravity. We match the thermodynamics and classical two point function between q-Schwarzian and Liouville gravity. We further prove the duality on the quantum level by rewriting sinh dilaton gravity as a topological gauge theory, and showing that the latter equals the q-Schwarzian. As the q-Schwarzian can be quantized exactly, this duality can be viewed as an exact solution of sinh dilaton gravity on the disk topology. For real q, this q-Schwarzian corresponds to double-scaled SYK and is dual to a sine dilaton gravity.",

However, a rigid body rotation with a constant angular velocity is admitted as in the case of the Boltzmann equation. The influence of the presence of a boundary is also discussed in simple situations.",

Formally, assuming an $\\varepsilon$-thin domain and anisotropic viscosities with vertical viscosity $ŒΩ_z=\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^Œ≥)$ where $Œ≥=2$, one obtains the primitive equations with full viscosity as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$. Here, we take two more limit equations into consideration: For $Œ≥<2$ the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. For $Œ≥>2$ the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity $-Œî_H$ as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$. Thus, there are three possible limits of the hydrostatic approximation depending on the assumption on the vertical viscosity. The latter convergence has been proven recently by Li, Titi, and Yuan using energy estimates. Here, we consider more generally $ŒΩ_z=\\varepsilon^2 Œ¥$ and show how maximal regularity methods and quadratic inequalities can be an efficient approach to the same end for $\\varepsilon,Œ¥\\to 0$. The flexibility of our methods is also illustrated by the convergence for $Œ¥\\to \\infty$ and $\\varepsilon\\to 0$ to the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations.",

We prove that there are representations of $\\mathbb{V}(Y,S)$ on the homology groups of various moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on $Y$ supported on $S$ constructed in a companion paper with Rapcak, defined by certain Hecke modifications of these sheaves along points and curve classes in the divisor $S$. This generalizes the common mathematical formulation of a conjecture of Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa, the special case in which $Y=\\mathbb{C}^3$ and $S=r[\\mathbb{C}^2]$, to toric threefolds and divisors as proposed by Gaiotto-Rapcak. We outline an approach to the general conjecture and prove many special cases and partial results using tools developed in the companion paper, following the proof of the original conjecture by Schiffmann-Vasserot and its generalization to divisors in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ by Rapcak-Soibelman-Yang-Zhao.\n  The vertex algebras $\\mathbb{V}(Y,S)$ conjecturally include $W$-superalgebras $ W_{f_0,f_1}^Œ∫(\\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ and genus zero class $\\mathcal{S}$ chiral algebras $\\mathbb{V}^{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\text{Gl}_m;f_1,...,f_k}$, each for general nilpotents $f_i$. By definition, this implies the existence of a family of compatible free field realizations of these vertex algebras, relevant to their parabolic induction and inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction. We prove these conjectures in the examples of lowest non-trivial rank for each case, and outline the proof in general for some cases.",

        "Abstract": "We consider two-dimensional systems of point particles located on rectangular lattices and interacting via pairwise potentials. The goal of this paper is to investigate the phase transitions (and their nature) at fixed density for the minimal energy of such systems. The 2D rectangle lattices we consider have an elementary cell of sides $a$ and $b$, the aspect ratio is defined as $Œî=b/a$ and the inverse particle density $A = a b$; therefore, the \"symmetric'' state with $Œî=1$ corresponds to the square lattice and the \"non-symmetric'' state to the rectangular lattice with $Œî\\ne 1$. For certain types of the interaction potential, by changing continuously the particle density, such lattice systems undertake at a specific value of the (inverse) particle density $A^*$ a structural transition from the symmetric to the non-symmetric state. The structural transition can be either of first order ($Œî$ unstick from its symmetric value $Œî=1$ discontinuously) or of second order ($Œî$ unstick from $Œî=1$ continuously); the first and second-order phase transitions are separated by the so-called tricritical point. We develop a general theory on how to determine the exact values of the transition densities and the location of the tricritical point. The general theory is applied to the double Yukawa and Yukawa-Coulomb potentials.",

The study explores the Lax-type integrability and bi-Hamiltonian properties of the systems, revealing the existence of compatible Poisson operators. The Lie-algebraic approach, particularly the AKS-algebraic and $\\mathcal{R}$-structure schemes, is employed to analyze the holomorphic loop Lie algebra, providing insights into the Lie-algebraic structure of heavenly equations. The Mikhalev-Pavlov and Pleba≈Ñski equations are studied in detail, and the associated Poisson brackets for specific coordinate functions are derived, revealing interesting mathematical properties.

        "Authors": "Ananda Roy, Hubert Saleur",
        "Abstract": "Topological interfaces of two-dimensional conformal field theories contain information about symmetries of the theory and exhibit striking spectral and entanglement characteristics. While lattice realizations of these interfaces have been proposed for unitary minimal models, the same has remained elusive for the paradigmatic Luttinger liquid {\\it i.e.,} the free, compact boson model. Here, we show that a topological interface of two Luttinger liquids can be realized by coupling special one-dimensional superconductors. The gapless excitations in the latter carry charges that are specific integer multiples of the charge of Cooper-pairs. The aforementioned integers are determined by the windings in the target space of the bosonic fields -- a crucial element required to give rise to nontrivial topological interfaces. The latter occur due to the perfect transmission of certain number of Cooper-pairs across the interface. The topological interfaces arise naturally in Josephson junction arrays with the simplest case being realized by an array of experimentally-demonstrated~$0-œÄ$ qubits, capacitors and ordinary Josephson junctions. Signatures of the topological interface are obtained through entanglement entropy computations. In particular, the subleading contribution to the so-called interface entropy is shown to differ from existing field theory predictions. The proposed lattice model provides an experimentally-realizable alternative to spin and anyon chains for the analysis of several conjectured conformal fixed points which have so far eluded ab-initio investigation.",

Specifically, we relate stationary points of hierarchies of $L^2$ resp. $L^1$-optimization problems by a conformal change of metric, provide an explicit construction of the conformal factors relating the relevant metrics and identify the field lines of physical vector fields fields as conformal geodesics. Despite the allowed topological complexity of the fields under consideration, these observations reveal geometric order which is obtained by merely pointwise rescaling of the metric.",

These are semimetals where bands meet generally in 1-dimensional submanifolds, which can generally be knots in $\\T^3$. These nodal loops have two charges, the quantized Berry phase and the $\\Z_2$-monopole charge, the second related to linking numbers of nodal knots between bands. We provide a manifestly topological proof of the Weyl charge cancellation condition for the $\\Z_2$ monopole charge, which is known to be the second Stiefel-Whitney class of a tubular neighbourhood surrounding a Weyl submanifold via the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.",

        "Abstract": "We study systems of differential equations driven by fast-oscillating functions of a Wiener process. In the limit when the frequency of oscillations goes to infinity, we identify the limiting SDE systems which are driven by several independent Wiener processes. The solutions of the original equations converge to those of the limiting system in law. The limiting equations include additional drift terms which have the form of Stratonovich corrections. Our result can thus be interpreted as a reqularization of SDE systems. The systems we study are motivated by experimental work on the motion of light-sensitive robots and on motility-induced phase separation in bacterial colonies.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we follow an idea that is opposite to the idea of Hopf and Cole: we use transformations in order to transform simpler linear or nonlinear differential equations (with known solutions) to more complicated nonlinear differential equations. In such a way, we can obtain numerous exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations. We apply this methodology to the classical parabolic differential equation (the wave equation), to the classical hyperbolic differential equation (the heat equation), and to the classical elliptic differential equation (Laplace equation). In addition, we use the methodology to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations by means of the solutions of linear differential equations and by means of the solutions of the nonlinear differential equations of Bernoulli and Riccati. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of the methodology to lead to exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations on the basis of known solutions of other nonlinear partial differential equations. As an example of this, we use the Korteweg--de Vries equation and its solutions. Traveling wave solutions of nonlinear differential equations are of special interest in this article. We demonstrate the existence of the following phenomena described by some of the obtained solutions: (i) occurrence of the solitary wave--solitary antiwave from the solution, which is zero at the initial moment (analogy of an occurrence of particle and antiparticle from the vacuum); (ii) splitting of a nonlinear solitary wave into two solitary waves (analogy of splitting of a particle into two particles); (iii) soliton behavior of some of the obtained waves; (iv) existence of solitons which move with the same velocity despite the different shape and amplitude of the solitons.",

Infinite series occur for all admissible values of the parameters (even values involving finite series), and are bounded and convergent in the entire range of the independent variable.

For this case, we show that correlations generically decay exponentially and provide an explicit formula for the correlation function between the operators supported on two and four neighbouring sites.",

        "Abstract": "Traveling waves of neural activity emerge in cortical networks both spontaneously and in response to stimuli. The spatiotemporal structure of waves can indicate the information they encode and the physiological processes that sustain them. Here, we investigate the stimulus-response relationships of traveling waves emerging in adaptive neural fields as a model of visual motion processing. Neural field equations model the activity of cortical tissue as a continuum excitable medium, and adaptive processes provide negative feedback, generating localized activity patterns. Synaptic connectivity in our model is described by an integral kernel that weakens dynamically due to activity-dependent synaptic depression, leading to marginally stable traveling fronts (with attenuated backs) or pulses of a fixed speed. Our analysis quantifies how weak stimuli shift the relative position of these waves over time, characterized by a wave response function we obtain perturbatively. Persistent and continuously visible stimuli model moving visual objects. Intermittent flashes that hop across visual space can produce the experience of smooth apparent visual motion. Entrainment of waves to both kinds of moving stimuli are well characterized by our theory and numerical simulations, providing a mechanistic description of the perception of visual motion.",

        "Authors": "San To Chan, Eliot Fried",
        "Abstract": "With the advent of new media art, artists have harnessed fluid dynamics to create captivating visual narratives. A striking technique known as dendritic painting employs mixtures of ink and isopropanol atop paint, yielding intricate tree-like patterns. To unravel the intricacies of that technique, we examine the spread of ink/alcohol droplets over liquid substrates with diverse rheological properties. On Newtonian substrates, the droplet size evolution exhibits two power laws, suggesting an underlying interplay between viscous and Marangoni forces. The leading edge of the droplet spreads as a precursor film with an exponent of 3/8, while its main body spreads with an exponent of 1/4. For a weakly shear-thinning acrylic resin substrate, the same power laws persist, but dendritic structures emerge, and the texture of the precursor film roughens. The observed roughness and growth exponents (3/4 and 3/5) suggest a connection to the quenched Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality class, hinting at the existence of quenched disorder in the liquid substrate. Mixing the resin with acrylic paint renders it more viscous and shear-thinning, refining the dendrite edges and further roughening the precursor film. At larger paint concentrations, the substrate becomes a power-law fluid. The roughness and growth exponents then approach 1/2 and 3/4, respectively, deviating from known universality classes. The ensuing structures have a fractal dimension of 1.68, characteristic of diffusion-limited aggregation. These findings underscore how the non-linear rheological properties of the liquid substrate, coupled with the Laplacian nature of Marangoni spreading, can overshadow the local kinetic roughening of the droplet interface.",

The nonlinear interaction leads to the generation of waves with frequencies that are multiples of the frequency of the incident wave, minus the frequency of the soliton, while the soliton experiences growth due to the absorption of particles from the incoming wave. We propose an analytical approach based on the Born approximation to calculate the amplitudes of scattered waves and, consequently, the number of particles absorbed by the soliton. This approach is validated through direct comparison with the results of numerical simulation.",

        "Abstract": "Neuromorphic computing promises to transform the current paradigm of traditional computing towards Non-Von Neumann dynamic energy-efficient problem solving. Thus, dynamic memory devices capable of simultaneously performing nonlinear operations (volatile) similar to neurons and also storing information (non-volatile) alike brain synapses are in the great demand. To satisfy these demands, a neuromorphic platform has to possess intrinsic complexity reflected in the built-in diversity of its physical operation mechanisms. Herein, we propose and demonstrate the novel concept of a memlumor - an all-optical device combining memory and luminophore, and being mathematically a full equivalence of the electrically-driven memristor. By utilizing metal halide perovskites as a memlumor material platform, we demonstrate the synergetic coexistence of both volatile and non-volatile memory effects within a broad timescale from ns to days. We elucidate the origin of such complex response to be related to the phenomena of photodoping and photochemistry activated by a tunable light input and explore several possible realizations of memlumor computing. Leveraging on the existence of a history-dependent photoluminescent quantum yield in various material platforms, the memlumor device concept will trigger multiple new research directions in both material science and optoelectronics. We anticipate that the memlumor, as a new optical dynamic computing element, will add a new dimension to existing optical technologies enabling their transition into application in photonic neuromorphic computing.",

Properties of elliptic functions including the quarter-period translations in the complex plane are applied to transform the solution to the simplest form.

By applying a small perturbation to the initial position of star S5, we can compare the evolution of this system to its unperturbed evolution. This results in the two solutions diverging exponentially, defined by the separation in position space $Œ¥_{r}$, with an average Lyapunov timescale of $\\sim$420 yr, corresponding to the largest positive Lyapunov exponent. Even though the general trend of the chaotic evolution is governed in part by the supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\\rm A^{*}$ (Sgr $\\rm A^{*}$), individual differences between the stars can be noted in the behaviour of their phase-space curves.\n  We present an analysis of the individual behaviour of the stars in this Newtonian chaotic dynamical system. The individuality of their behaviour is evident from offsets in the position space separation curves of the S-stars and the black hole. We propose that the offsets originate from the initial orbital elements of the S-stars, where Sgr $\\rm A^{*}$ is considered in one of the focal points of the Keplerian orbits. Methods were considered to find a relationship between these elements and the separation in position space. Symbolic regression turns out to provide the clearest diagnostics for finding an interpretable expression for the problem. Our symbolic regression model indicates that $\\left\\langleŒ¥_r\\right\\rangle \\propto e$, implying that the time-averaged individual separation in position space is directly proportional to the initial eccentricity of the S-stars.",

        "Authors": "Hsuan-Wei Lee, Colin Cleveland, Attila Szolnoki",
        "Abstract": "Taxes are an essential and uniformly applied institution for maintaining modern societies. However, the levels of taxation remain an intensive debate topic among citizens. If each citizen contributes to common goals, a minimal tax would be sufficient to cover common expenses. However, this is only achievable at high cooperation level; hence, a larger tax bracket is required. A recent study demonstrated that if an appropriate tax partially covers the punishment of defectors, cooperation can be maintained above a critical level of the multiplication factor, characterizing the synergistic effect of common ventures. Motivated by real-life experiences, we revisited this model by assuming an interactive structure among competitors. All other model elements, including the key parameters characterizing the cost of punishment, fines, and tax level, remain unchanged. The aim was to determine how the spatiality of a population influences the competition of strategies when punishment is partly based on a uniform tax paid by all participants. This extension results in a more subtle system behavior in which different ways of coexistence can be observed, including dynamic pattern formation owing to cyclic dominance among competing strategies.",

        "Authors": "Shuning Lin, Yong Chen",
        "Abstract": "Due to the dynamic characteristics of instantaneity and steepness, employing domain decomposition techniques for simulating rogue wave solutions is highly appropriate. Wherein, the backward compatible PINN (bc-PINN) is a temporally sequential scheme to solve PDEs over successive time segments while satisfying all previously obtained solutions. In this work, we propose improvements to the original bc-PINN algorithm in two aspects based on the characteristics of error propagation. One is to modify the loss term for ensuring backward compatibility by selecting the earliest learned solution for each sub-domain as pseudo reference solution. The other is to adopt the concatenation of solutions obtained from individual subnetworks as the final form of the predicted solution. The improved backward compatible PINN (Ibc-PINN) is applied to study data-driven higher-order rogue waves for the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger (NLS) equation and the AB system to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages. Transfer learning and initial condition guided learning (ICGL) techniques are also utilized to accelerate the training. Moreover, the error analysis is conducted on each sub-domain and it turns out that the slowdown of Ibc-PINN in error accumulation speed can yield greater advantages in accuracy. In short, numerical results fully indicate that Ibc-PINN significantly outperforms bc-PINN in terms of accuracy and stability without sacrificing efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.",

        "Abstract": "Quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to display a spectrum whose fine-grained features (gaps and correlations) are well described by Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We propose and develop a complementary version of this conjecture: quantum chaotic systems display a Lanczos spectrum whose local means and covariances are well described by RMT. To support this proposal, we first demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems. We then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and covariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time behavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor, as well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with continuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time averages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean Lanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the statistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum chaos. Finally, we clarify the relation between spread complexity and the universality classes of RMT by exploring various values of the Dyson index and Poisson distributed spectra.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence of self-synchronization has been observed in multi-electrode corona discharge systems, where the application of high negative DC voltages induces a self-sustained mode of current pulse trains. These pulses, historically referred to as Trichel pulses, characterize the operation of a two-electrode system where the discharge electrode is subjected to a high negative DC voltage. The numerical algorithm indicates that in a multi-electrode discharge system, comprising multiple two-electrode discharges, each two-electrode system independently produces pulse trains. These systems, each comprising a pair of electrodes, operate in a pulsed mode, with synchronization emerging from weak yet significant interactions among them. These interactions arise from the mutual influence of electric fields and space charges generated by each discharge pair. This influence extends beyond individual systems, leading to a synchronization between both pairs, both in a pulsed mode. A three-species model of discharge was employed to simulate this process and it was based on the finite element method formulation. Two different numerical models were investigated, a 2D model, consisting of two discharge electrodes and a third grounded electrode, and two 1D-axisymmetric models, consisting dual and triple pairs of discharge systems. Experiments show a multi-stable nature of the coupled pulsed discharge systems, indicating that under appropriate conditions the pulse trains exhibit two distinct modes of synchronization: in-phase synchronization and anti-phase synchronization. The occurrence of each mode depends on factors such as interaction strength, applied voltage level, and various system parameters. Furthermore, variations in these factors can lead to additional outcomes, including out of phase synchronization, as well as scenarios involving near-harmonic oscillations and quenching.",

We show that such reflection maps are smoothly conjugate to the composite of permutation maps, with corresponding reduced Yang-Baxter maps. In the case when the reduced Yang-Baxter maps are independent of parameters, the latter are just braiding operators. We also study the symplectic and Poisson geometry of such reflection maps. In a special case, the factorization problems are associated with the collision of N-solitons of the n-Manakov system with a boundary, and in this context the N-body polarization reflection map is a symplectomorphism.",

These systems are all around us in nature, like bacterial colonies, fish schools, bird flocks, as well as in technology, such as microswimmers and robotics, to name a few. Flocking and swarming are two key components of the collective behaviours of multi-agent systems. In flocking, the agents coordinate their direction of motion, but in swarming, they congregate in space to organise their spatial position. We investigate a minimal mathematical model of locally interacting multi-agent system where the agents simultaneously swarm in space and exhibit flocking behaviour. Various cluster structures are found, depending on the interaction range. When the coupling strength value exceeds a crucial threshold, flocking behaviour is observed. We do in-depth simulations and report the findings by changing the other parameters and with the incorporation of noise.",

        "Abstract": "Reservoir Computing (RC) is a paradigm in artificial intelligence where a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to process temporal data, leveraging the inherent dynamical properties of the reservoir to perform complex computations. In the realm of RC, the excitatory-inhibitory balance b has been shown to be pivotal for driving the dynamics and performance of Echo State Networks (ESN) and, more recently, Random Boolean Network (RBN). However, the relationship between b and other parameters of the network is still poorly understood. This article explores how the interplay of the balance b, the connectivity degree K (i.e., the number of synapses per neuron) and the size of the network (i.e., the number of neurons N) influences the dynamics and performance (memory and prediction) of an RBN reservoir. Our findings reveal that K and b are strongly tied in optimal reservoirs. Reservoirs with high K have two optimal balances, one for globally inhibitory networks (b<0), and the other one for excitatory networks (b>0). Both show asymmetric performances about a zero balance. In contrast, for moderate K, the optimal value being K=4, best reservoirs are obtained when excitation and inhibition almost, but not exactly, balance each other. For almost all K, the influence of the size is such that increasing N leads to better performance, even with large values of N. Our investigation provides clear directions to generate optimal reservoirs or reservoirs with constraints on size or connectivity.",

Here we study the eigenstate spectrum, its localization properties and the effect on dynamics, focusing on the two-excitation sector relevant for nonlinear photonics. These models admit two sources of disorder: in the coupling between the spins and the cavity and in the energy shifts of the individual spins. While this model was known to be exactly solvable in the limit of a homogeneous coupling and inhomogeneous energy shifts, we here establish the solvability in the opposite limit of a homogeneous energy shift and inhomogeneous coupling, presenting the exact solution and corresponding conserved quantities. We identify three different classes of eigenstates, exhibiting different degrees of multifractality and semilocalization closely tied to the integrable points, and study their stability to perturbations away from these solvable points. The dynamics of the cavity occupation number away from equilibrium, exhibiting boson bunching and a two-photon blockade, is explicitly related to the localization properties of the eigenstates and illustrates how these models support a collective spin description despite the presence of disorder.",

Meanwhile, the individual advantages or collective disadvantages from this unnecessary effort may accumulate over time, such as the long-term validity of test scores. To identify the role of this memory factor, we propose a memory-based involution game model. In a more competitive environment, our findings suggest: (i) with scant social resources, increasing memory length curbs involution, (ii) with moderate resources, increasing memory length initially intensifies involution but later reduces it, and (iii) with abundant social resources, increasing memory length amplifies involution. Conversely, in a less competitive environment, involution consistently decreases with a larger memory length. Our research provides insights into mitigating involution by considering memory effects.",

We go beyond these findings by considering two rotating in opposite directions coupled stable heteroclinic cycles between weak chimeras. Such an ensemble can be mathematically described by a system of six phase equations. Using two parameter bifurcation analysis we investigate the scenarios of appearance and destruction of chaotic dynamics in the system under study.",

        "Authors": "Henrique M. Borges, V√≠tor V. Vasconcelos, Fl√°vio L. Pinheiro",
        "Abstract": "Recently, social debates have been marked by increased polarization of social groups. Such polarization not only implies that groups cannot reach a consensus on fundamental questions but also materializes in more modular social spaces/networks that further amplify the risks of polarization in less polarizing topics. How can network adaptation bridge different communities when individuals reveal homophilic or heterophilic social rewiring preferences? Here, we consider information diffusion processes that capture a continuum from simple to complex contagion processes. We use a computational model to understand how fast and to what extent individual rewiring preferences bridge initially weakly connected communities and how likely it is for them to reach a consensus. We show that homophilic and heterophilic rewiring have different impacts depending on the type of opinion spread. First, in the case of complex opinion diffusion, we show that even polarized social networks can reach a population-wide consensus without reshaping their underlying network. When polarized social structures amplify opinion polarization, heterophilic rewiring preferences play a key role in creating bridges between communities and facilitating a population-wide consensus. Secondly, in the case of simple opinion diffusion, homophilic rewiring preferences are more capable of fostering consensus and avoiding a co-existence (dynamical polarization) of opinions. Hence, across a broad profile of simple and complex opinion diffusion processes, only a mix of heterophilic and homophilic rewiring preferences avoids polarization and promotes consensus.",

It has been widely used in the theory of pattern formation. Following a recent study by Bramburger and Holzer [2], we consider discrete SHE on deterministic and random graphs. The two families of the discrete models share the same continuum limit in the form of a nonlocal SHE on a circle. The analysis of the continuous system, parallel to the analysis of the classical SHE, shows bifurcations of spatially periodic solutions at critical values of the control parameters. However, the proximity of the discrete models to the continuum limit does not guarantee that the same bifurcations take place in the discrete setting in general, because some of the symmetries of the continuous model do not survive discretization.\n  We use the center manifold reduction and normal forms to obtain precise information about the number and stability of solutions bifurcating from the homogeneous state in the discrete models on deterministic and sparse random graphs. Moreover, we present detailed numerical results for the discrete SHE on the nearest-neighbor and small-world graphs.",

        "Abstract": "Fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems accumulate over time. Stochastic resetting, where the state of a system is reset to extrinsically predefined conditions at random times, is a paradigm for studying the constraint of fluctuations. Here, we show that cooperative resetting in many-particle systems can constrain fluctuations in a self-organized manner. We show that systems where pairs of particles are reset to their mean position exhibit phase transitions between delocalized and localized states, which exhibit altered response and improved search behavior compared to extrinsic resetting.",

We use these amplitudes to understand chaotic and thermal aspects of the excited string states lending support to the Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence principle. The unaveraged amplitudes exhibit chaos in the resonance distribution as a function of kinematic parameters, which can be described by random matrix theory. Upon coarse-graining these amplitudes are shown to exponentiate, and capture various thermal features, including features of a stringy version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as notions of typicality. Further, we compute the effective string form factor corresponding to the highly excited states, and argue for the random walk behaviour of the long strings.",

We suggest some future directions for swarmalator research and point out some connections to the Kuramoto model and the Vicsek model from active matter; these are intended as a call-to-arms for the sync community and other researchers looking for new problems and puzzles to work on.",

        "Abstract": "Can we build an artificial system that would be able to generate endless surprises if ran \"forever\" in Minecraft? While there is not a single path toward solving that grand challenge, this article presents what we believe to be some working ingredients for the endless generation of novel increasingly complex artifacts in Minecraft. Our framework for an open-ended system includes two components: a complex system used to recursively grow and complexify artifacts over time, and a discovery algorithm that leverages the concept of meta-diversity search. Since complex systems have shown to enable the emergence of considerable complexity from set of simple rules, we believe them to be great candidates to generate all sort of artifacts in Minecraft. Yet, the space of possible artifacts that can be generated by these systems is often unknown, challenging to characterize and explore. Therefore automating the long-term discovery of novel and increasingly complex artifacts in these systems is an exciting research field. To approach these challenges, we formulate the problem of meta-diversity search where an artificial \"discovery assistant\" incrementally learns a diverse set of representations to characterize behaviors and searches to discover diverse patterns within each of them. A successful discovery assistant should continuously seek for novel sources of diversities while being able to quickly specialize the search toward a new unknown type of diversity. To implement those ideas in the Minecraft environment, we simulate an artificial \"chemistry\" system based on Lenia continuous cellular automaton for generating artifacts, as well as an artificial \"discovery assistant\" (called Holmes) for the artifact-discovery process. Holmes incrementally learns a hierarchy of modular representations to characterize divergent sources of diversity and uses a goal-based intrinsically-motivated exploration as the diversity search strategy.",

Deriving the equations of motion within $f(R)$ gravitational theories, novel solutions for charged and neutral black holes are obtained, introducing a dimensional parameter $a$ in $f(R)=R-2a\\sqrt{R}$. Departing from General Relativity, these solutions showcase unique properties reliant on the dynamics of Ricci scalar. Analysis shows that chaos manifests within a specific energy range, with $a$ playing a crucial role. The study underscores the general applicability of the spherically symmetric metric, revealing insights into particle dynamics near black hole horizons. Despite an initially integrable nature, the introduction of harmonic perturbation leads to chaos, aligning with the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of black hole dynamics, emphasizing the importance of alternative theories of gravity.",

Their geometry, particularly their fractal dimension, depends on the agglomeration process (diffusion-limited or ballistic growth by adding single particles or cluster-cluster aggregation). However, in practice, the packing structure depends not only on the initial formation but also on the mechanical processing of the agglomerate after it has grown. Surprisingly, the packing converges to a statistically invariant structure under certain process conditions, independent of the initial growth process. We consider the repeated fragmentation on a given length scale, followed by ballistic agglomeration. Examples of fragmentation are sieving with a given mesh size or dispersion in a turbulent fluid. We model the agglomeration by gravitational sedimentation. The asymptotic structure is fractal up to the fragmentation length scale, and the fragments have a power-law size distribution. A scaling relation connects the power law and the fractal dimension.",

        "Authors": "Brandon C. Y. Yeung, Oliver T. Schmidt",
        "Abstract": "An adaptive algorithm for spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of mixed broadband-tonal turbulent flows is developed. Sharp peak resolution at tonal frequencies is achieved by locally minimizing bias. Smooth spectrum estimates of broadband regions are achieved by locally reducing variance. The method utilizes multitaper estimation with sine tapers. An iterative criterion based on modal convergence is introduced to enable the SPOD to adapt to spectral features. For tonal flows, the adaptivity is controlled by a single user input; for broadband flows, a constant number of sine tapers is recommended without adaptivity. The discrete version of Parseval's theorem for SPOD is stated. Proper normalization of the tapers ensures that Parseval's theorem is satisfied in expectation. Drastic savings in computational complexity and memory usage are facilitated by two aspects: (i) sine tapers, which permit post hoc windowing of a single Fourier transform; and (ii) time-domain lossless compression using a QR or eigenvalue decomposition. Sine-taper SPOD is demonstrated on time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) data from an open cavity flow and high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES) data from a round jet, with and without adaptivity. For the tonal cavity flow, the adaptive algorithm outperforms Slepian-based multitaper SPOD in terms of variance reduction, local bias, mode convergence, and memory usage. For both the tonal cavity and the broadband jet flows, results comparable to or better than those from standard SPOD based on Welch's overlapped segment averaging are obtained with up to 75% fewer snapshots. Based on these examples, best practice is established.",

Understanding its structure is challenging, especially if the system of interest has many degrees of freedom so that visualizations of trajectories are of limited use. To analyze recurrent phenomena, we propose a computational method to identify oscillations and the transitions between them. To this end, we introduce the concept of cycling signature, which is a topological descriptor of a trajectory segment. The advantage of a topological approach, in particular in an application setting, is that it is robust to noise. Cycling signatures are computable from data and provide a comprehensive global description of oscillations through their statistics over many trajectory segments. We demonstrate this through three examples. In particular, we identify and analyze six oscillations in a four-dimensional system with a hyperchaotic attractor.",

        "Abstract": "From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and that can be driven by external fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons towards opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations -- so-called non-Hermitian skin waves, which are typically unstable -- into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We rationalize our observations by introducing non-reciprocal generalizations of the Frenkel-Kontorova and sine-Gordon models, and use the latter to predict the terminal velocity of the (anti)solitons and determine their stability. Finally, we harness non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. More broadly, our findings suggest that non-reciprocal driving is a robust mechanism to steer nonlinear waves and could be generalized beyond mechanics, e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.",

Our results explain, in a brief and simple manner, previous findings in the theory of Riemann invariants for hydrodynamic-type equations. Facts concerning the structure of families of almost rectifiable vector fields, their relation to Hamiltonian integrable systems, and practical procedures for studying such vector fields are developed. We also introduce and analyse almost rectifiable Lie algebras, which are motivated by geometric, algebraic, and practical reasons. We classify one-, two-, and three-dimensional almost rectifiable Lie algebras, as well as four- and five-dimensional indecomposable almost rectifiable Lie algebras, and other higher-dimensional ones. New methods for solving systems of hydrodynamic-type equations are established to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular, we study several hydrodynamic-type systems of partial differential equations. Hydrodynamic-type systems admitting k-wave solutions with an associated almost rectifiable Lie algebra of vector fields are defined. We provide new methods for obtaining the submanifolds related to Riemann invariants through almost rectifiable Lie algebras of vector fields and partial differential equations admitting a (nonlinear) superposition rule: the so-called PDE Lie systems.",

A systematic study of the fragmentation of incident nuclei with multiple formation of the lightest fragments of He and H. This made it possible to study the dynamics of unstable nuclear states of $^8$Be, the Hoyle state and the 4$Œ±$-particle state of the $^{16}$O nucleus above the threshold in the relativistic dissociation of nuclei due to precision measurements of fragment emission angles. It is shown that to reconstruct the relativistic decays of unstable nuclei in a nuclear track emulsion, it is sufficient to determine the invariant mass of the system of He and H fragments in the approximation of conservation of momentum per nucleon of the parent nucleus. This approach allows one to search for more complex nuclear states. An indication has been obtained of growing probability to detect $^8$Be with increasing the number of relativistic $Œ±$ particles in the event.",

        "Abstract": "The hexadecapole deformation, as well as the quadrupole one, influences the low-lying states of finite nuclei. The hexadecapole correlations are often overshadowed by the large quadrupole effects, and hence have not been much investigated. Here we address the relevance of hexadecapole deformations in the calculations of low-energy collective states of heavy nuclei using the theoretical framework of the self-consistent mean-field method and the interacting-boson approximation. The interacting-boson Hamiltonian that explicitly includes the quadrupole and hexadecapole collective degrees of freedom is specified by a choice of a universal energy density functional and pairing interaction. In an illustrative application to axially-deformed Gd isotopes, it is shown that the inclusion of the hexadecapole degree of freedom does not affect most of the low-spin and low-lying states qualitatively, but that has notable effects in that it significantly improves the description of high-spin states of the ground-state bands of nearly spherical vibrational nuclei, and that gives rise to $K^œÄ=4^+$ bands exhibiting strong $E4$ transitions in strongly deformed nuclei.",

        "Abstract": "Collisions of atomic nuclei at relativistic velocities produce new particles, predominantly mesons containing one valence quark and one valence anti-quark. These particles are produced in strong interactions, which preserve an approximate symmetry between up ($u$) and down ($d$) quarks. In the case of $K$ meson production, if this symmetry were exact, it would result in equal numbers of charged ($K^+$ and $K^-$) and neutral ($K^0$ and $\\overline{K}$$^0$) mesons in the final state. In this Letter, we report a measurement of the relative abundance of charged over neutral $K$ meson production in collisions of argon and scandium nuclei at a center-of-mass energy of 11.9~GeV per nucleon pair. We find that production of $K^+$ and $K^-$ mesons at mid-rapidity displays a significant excess of $(23.3\\pm 5.7)\\%$ relative to that of the neutral $K$ mesons. The origin of this unexpected excess remains to be elucidated.",

We compare the spectral functions with different chiral symmetry restoration scenarios. We find that the scenario with proper chiral symmetry restoration that takes into account the degenerate $œÅ$ and $a_1$ mesons leads to an increase of the yield in the window of $1.1<M<1.4$ GeV. Whereas, the low-temperature theorem of chiral mixing extrapolated toward a chiral crossover, often used in the literature, leads to a substantial overestimate at $M=1.2$ GeV.",

Experimentally, $^{28}$Si exhibits shape coexistence between an oblate ground state and an excited prolate structure. The oblate rotational band is described well within the $sd$ shell using the USDB interaction. However, for the prolate band, a modification of this interaction is required, lowering the single-particle energy of the $1d_{3/2}$ orbit. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of a superdeformed configuration in $^{28}$Si. Our calculations, spanning both the $sd$ and $pf$ shells, rule out the existence of a superdeformed $0^+$ bandhead within an excitation energy range of 10-20 MeV.",

The global parametrization for the DD-$Œ±N$ interaction is obtained based on the proton-$^4$He OMP which reproduces the elastic scattering cross-section data very well in the incident energies of 12.04--500 MeV per nucleon. We derive the $Œ±$-nucleus potential by a folding procedure with the point-nucleon density obtained by a microscopic mean-field model using the present DD-$Œ±N$ interaction. The density dependence of the DD-$Œ±N$ interaction is fixed phenomenologically to reproduce the $Œ±$-nucleus elastic scattering cross-section data by the $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{58}$Ni, $^{90}$Zr, and $^{208}$Pb targets at $E/A =$ 10--342.5 MeV. We also show the total reaction cross sections, which are helpful in fixing one free parameter, the renormalization factor for the imaginary part of the $Œ±$-nucleus potential. Lastly, we show some examples, which clearly demonstrate the validity and power of the present DD-$Œ±N$ approach.",

The excitation function of the $Œõ$ polarization shows a significant splitting between polarizations of $Œõ$ and $\\barŒõ$, which challenges a widespread interpretation that the splitting is affected mainly by the late-stage magnetic field.",

We perform Bayesian analyses in which EoS parameters are varied simultaneously within the Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics-Skyrme (ImQMD-Sky) transport code to obtain a multivariate correlated constraint. The varied parameters include symmetry energy, $S_0$, and slope of the symmetry energy, $L$, at saturation density, isoscalar effective mass, $m_{s}^*/m_{N}$, isovector effective mass, $m_{v}^{*}/m_{N}$ and the in-medium cross-section enhancement factor $Œ∑$. We find that the flow and VarXZ observables are sensitive to the splitting of proton and neutron effective masses and the in-medium cross-section. Comparisons of ImQMD-Sky predictions to the S$œÄ$RIT data suggest a narrow range of preferred values for $m_{s}^*/m_{N}$, $m_{v}^{*}/m_{N}$ and $Œ∑$.",

        "Authors": "Latsamy Xayavong, Yeunhwan Lim",
        "Abstract": "The isospin-symmetry breaking correction, denoted as $Œ¥_C$, is introduced for the first time within the shell-model framework to the nuclear matrix element of Gamow-Teller transitions. $Œ¥_C$ is separated into two components: the isospin mixing term, $Œ¥_{C1}$, induced by the Coulomb and nuclear charge-dependent forces in the effective Hamiltonian, and the radial mismatch term, $Œ¥_{C2}$, arising from differences between proton and neutron realistic wave functions. Consequently, the refinement strategy developed for superallowed $0^+\\rightarrow 0^+$ Fermi transitions is applied to Gamow-Teller transitions as well. It is demonstrated that, to a given precision level, the shell model calculation of $Œ¥_C$ converges much faster than the calculation of the transition matrix element. Furthermore, higher-order correction terms are investigated and considered for consistent study of our works. Various interesting properties of the leading correction terms are discovered within the two-level model and parentage expansion of the one-body transition densities in angular momentum and isospin spaces. One such property is the dependence of $Œ¥_{C1}$ on the isospin admixture amplitude, $Œ±$, starting from the first order, while the same model yields $Œ¥_{C1} = Œ±^2$ for Fermi transitions. The calculated $Œ¥_C$ values are then utilized to evaluate the mirror asymmetry of Gamow-Teller transition strengths, which are compared with available experimental data and other theoretical calculations. Due to the refined fitting procedure of the Woods-Saxon potential parameters and the improved convergence as a function of intermediate state number, our results show better agreement on average compared to those of Smirnova and Volpe [Nucl. Phys. {\\bf A 714}, 441 (2003)].",

We show that this phenomenon is naturally explained by invoking impact parameter ($b$) fluctuations, which contribute to the variance, and gradually disappear in ultra-central collisions. It implies that $N_{ch}$ and $[ p_t ]$ are strongly correlated at fixed $b$, which is explained by the local thermalization of the QGP medium.",

        "Abstract": "Within the Energy Density Functional (EDF) approach, the use of mean-field wave-functions deliberately breaking (some) symmetries of the underlying Hamiltonian is an efficient and largely utilized way to incorporate static correlations. However, the restoration of broken symmetries is eventually mandatory to recover the corresponding quantum numbers and to achieve a more precise description of nuclear properties.\n  While symmetry-restored calculations are routinely performed to study ground-state properties and low-lying excitations, similar applications to the nuclear response are essentially limited to either formal studies or to schematic models. In the present paper, the effect of angular momentum restoration on the monopole and quadrupole responses of doubly open-shell nuclei is investigated.\n  Based on deformed Skyrme-Random Phase Approximation (RPA) calculations, the exact Angular Momentum Projection (AMP) is implemented in the calculation of the multipole strength functions, thus defining a projection after variation (PAV-RPA) scheme. The method is employed for the first time in a realistic study to investigate the effect of AMP on the coupling of monopole and quadrupole modes in $^{24}$Mg resulting from its intrinsic deformation.",

        "Abstract": "Laser technologies improved after the understanding of the Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) which allows energetic laser beams to be compressed to tens of femtosecond (fs) pulse durations and focused to few $Œº$m. Protons of tens of MeV can be accelerated using for instance the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) method and focused on secondary targets. In such conditions, nuclear reactions can occur and radioisotopes relevant for medical purposes be produced. High repetition lasers can be used to produce enough isotopes for medical applications. This route is competitive to conventional methods mostly based on accelerators. In this paper we study the production of $^{67}$Cu, $^{63}$Zn, $^{18}$F and $^{11}$C currently used in positron emission tomography (PET) and other applications. At the same time, we study the reaction $^{10}$B(p,$Œ±$)$^{7}$Be and $^{70}$Zn(p,4n)$^{67}$Ga to put further constraints to the proton distributions at different angles and to the reaction $^{11}$B(p,$Œ±$)$^{8}$Be relevant for energy production. The experiment was performed at the 1 petawatt (PW) laser facility at Vega III located in Salamanca-Spain. Angular distributions of radioisotopes in the forward (with respect to the laser direction) and backward directions were measured using a High Purity Germanium Detector (HPGE). Our results are reasonably reproduced by the numerical estimates following the approach of Kimura et al. (NIMA637(2011)167)",

Today, the science of rare isotopes is on the cusp of a new era with theoretical and computing advances complementing experimental capabilities at new facilities internationally. In this article we present a vision for the science of rare isotope beams (RIBs). We do not attempt to cover the full breadth of the field, but rather provide a perspective and address a selection of topics that reflect our own interests and expertise. We focus in particular on systems near the drip lines, where one often finds nuclei that are referred to as \"exotic,\" and where the role of the \"nuclear continuum\" is only just starting to be explored. An important aspect of this article is the attempt to highlight the crucial connections between nuclear structure and nuclear reactions required to fully interpret and leverage the rich data to be collected in the next years at RIB facilities. Further, we connect the efforts in structure and reactions to key questions of nuclear astrophysics.",

        "Authors": "Jianhui Zhu",
        "Abstract": "The study of heavy-flavour mesons and baryons in hadronic collisions provides unique access to the properties of heavy-quark hadronisation in the presence of large partonic densities, where new mechanisms of hadron formation beyond in-vacuum fragmentation can emerge. Performing these measurements in intervals of charged-particle multiplicities across different collision systems provides sensitivity to understand whether different hadronisation mechanisms are at play in small and large hadronic colliding systems.\n  In this contribution, a selection of the latest charm and beauty production measurements in proton--proton (pp) collisions is presented, which can shed light on the modification of the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanisms with respect to leptonic collisions. New published results of the production of all prompt charm ground states in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, which allowed us to measure the charm fragmentation fractions and the total $\\rm c\\bar{c}$ production cross section at midrapidity, will be shown. The new final measurement of non-prompt (i.e. originating from beauty-hadron decays) $\\rm Œõ_c^+$ baryons in the same collisions system will be discussed to provide a quantitative comparison between the hadronisation properties of beauty and charm hadrons. New measurements of $\\rm Œû_c^0$ production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, and of $\\rm Œû_c^0$ production in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$~TeV, will be also presented, shedding further light on the hadronisation of charm-strange baryons in different colliding systems.",

        "Authors": "Ayala Glick-Magid",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, the non-relativistic effective theory (NRET) has been widely used for direct detection of dark matter and $Œº\\to e$ conversion. Nevertheless, existing literature has not fully considered tensor interactions, introducing a critical gap in our understanding. This study addresses this omission by integrating tensor amplitudes into the NRET framework, employing a novel approach for decomposing antisymmetric tensor-type interactions. This work establishes the connection between the tensor amplitudes and the non-relativistic Galilean-invariant operators. Specifically, it explores this relationship up to the leading order in momentum transfer, stemming from the exchange of spin-half particles in dark matter scenarios, and extends the analysis to the lepton-velocities orders for $Œº\\to e$ conversion cases. To facilitate further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables containing the requisite tensor matrix elements at finite momentum transfer are furnished, encompassing all possible Lorentz-invariant terms. These tensor terms are crucial to the analysis of ongoing experiments of dark matter detection through scattering off nuclei, as well as charged-lepton flavor violation in the $Œº\\to e$ conversion. Upon successful detection, they will contribute significantly to the comprehension of the nature of these new physics interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an expanding interest in experimental studies of $Œ≤$ electrons (electrons emitted in $Œ≤^-$ decay transitions) and their energy distributions, the so-called $Œ≤$-electron spectra. These experiments are interested mainly in $Œ≤$ transitions with electron spectra sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling $g_{\\rm A}$. In the present paper we make an extensive search for $g_{\\rm A}$ sensitive $Œ≤$ spectral shapes in the $A=86-99$ region using the nuclear shell model with the well established Hamiltonians $\\textit{glekpn}$ and $\\textit{jj45pnb}$, designed to render a good description of the spectroscopic properties of nuclei in this mass region. We have found eight $Œ≤^-$ decay transitions with various degrees of $g_{\\rm A}$ sensitivity. Moreover, these transitions are also important in pinning down the value of the so-called small relativistic vector nuclear matrix element, sNME. In addition, some of the corresponding mother nuclei are important contributors to the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. All this means that the found $Œ≤$ transitions are potentially of great interest for future rare-events experiments.",

The energy spectrum of the electrons emitted in this $Œ≤$-decay transition ($Œ≤$-electron spectrum) is sensitive to the wave functions of the involved initial ($9/2^+$) and final ($5/2^+$) nuclear ground states through the many involved nuclear matrix elements (NME). The $Œ≤$-electron spectrum of this transition is potentially indicative of the effective value, $g_{\\rm A}^{\\rm eff}$, of the weak axial coupling, $g_{\\rm A}$, of crucial importance for extraction of information on beyond-the-standard-model physics from the results of the present and future rare-events experiments. We describe the $Œ≤$ spectral shape of this decay by using a state-of-the-art $Œ≤$-decay formalism and compute the many involved NME using the well established NSM Hamiltonians $jj45pnb$ and $glekpn$. We have found a strong dependence of the $Œ≤$ spectral shape on the value of $g_{\\rm A}$ making it a good candidate for determination of the value of $g_{\\rm A}^{\\rm eff}$ through comparison with the corresponding experimental $Œ≤$ spectral shape. We have also found an interesting dependence of the $Œ≤$ spectral shape on the value of the so-called small relativistic vector NME, sNME, used to match the computed half-life with the measured one.",

In this proceeding, recent ALICE measurements of these effects are summarized.

        "Abstract": "Measurements at RHIC and the LHC show strongly enhanced baryon-to-meson yield ratios at intermediate transverse momenta ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) in high-energy nuclear collisions compared to $p$+$p$ baseline. This enhancement is attributed to the following QGP effects: strong hydrodynamic flow and parton recombination. Jet probes have been used extensively to gain insights into QGP properties, with substantial modifications to jet yields and internal structures seen across multiple measurements. Despite apparent medium-induced changes to jet fragmentation patterns, the LHC results indicate that in-jet baryon-to-meson ratios remain similar to that of $p$+$p$ measurements and are significantly different from that of the QGP bulk. To explore this behavior at RHIC, we employ particle identification through time-of-flight and TPC $dE/dx$ information alongside jet-track correlations to measure in-jet particle ratios for $p_{\\rm{T}} < 5.0$ GeV/$c$. We present the first in-cone baryon-to-meson yield ratios associated with fully reconstructed jets from Au+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC.",

The measurements are conducted using two-particle correlations with a pseudorapidity requirement of $|Œ∑| <$ 0.9 and a pair gap of $|ŒîŒ∑|>1.0$. The primary focus of this paper is on the analysis procedures and methods employed, especially the subtraction of non-flow contributions. Four well-established non-flow subtraction methods are applied to determine $v_n$, and their validity is verified using the HIJING event generator. The $v_n$ values are compared across the three collision systems at similar multiplicities, which allows for cancellation of final state effects and isolation of the impact of the initial geometry. While the $v_2$ values display differences among these collision systems, the $v_3$ values are largely similar, consistent with the expectations of subnucleon fluctuations in the initial geometry. The ordering of $v_n$ differs quantitatively from previous measurements obtained using two-particle correlations with a larger rapidity gap; this difference could be partially attributed to the effects of flow decorrelations in the rapidity direction.",

The unknown parameters of these forces are obtained by fitting the experimental binding energies of the $1s$ $Œõ$ single-particle state in various hypernuclei using the ``Simulated Annealing Method''. These forces are then used to calculate the binding energies of the other ($1p, 1d, 1f, 1g$) $Œõ$ single-particle states in the different hypernuclei. The predicted values are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for the three forces constructed. In addition, we calculate also the root-mean-square radii of ground state $Œõ$ orbital, as well as several global properties of the hypernuclei considered such as their ground-state Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov energy, their pairing energy and their quadrupole moment.",

This measurement completes the mass information for the lightest remaining proton-dripline nucleus achievable with Penning traps. $^{22}$Al has been the subject of recent interest regarding a possible halo structure from the observation of an exceptionally large isospin asymmetry [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{125} 192503 (2020)]. The measured mass excess value of $\\text{ME}=18\\;093.6(7)$~keV, corresponding to an exceptionally small proton separation energy of $S_p = 99.2(1.0)$~keV, is compatible with the suggested halo structure. Our result agrees well with predictions from \\textit{sd}-shell USD Hamiltonians. While USD Hamiltonians predict deformation in $^{22}$Al ground-state with minimal $1s_{1/2}$ occupation in the proton shell, a particle-plus-rotor model in the continuum suggests that a proton halo could form at large quadrupole deformation. These results emphasize the need for a charge radius measurement to conclusively determine the halo nature.",

        "Title": "About the magnitude of the $Œ≥^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transverse amplitudes near $Q^2=0$",
        "Authors": "G. Ramalho",
        "Abstract": "The $Œ≥^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transition has a property that differs from the other low lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the transverse helicity amplitudes. The transition helicity amplitudes are defined in terms of square transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small. This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at the pseudothreshold (the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at rest and $Q^2 <0$), where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large $Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge invariant parametrization of the $Œ≥^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transition current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of two {\\it elementary} form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the correlation between the these elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$. The description the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$, a region with almost non existent data. We conclude at the end that the low $Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.",

        "Abstract": "The mean transverse momentum of produced particles, [pt], and its event-by-event fluctuations give direct access to the initial conditions of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions and help probe the colliding nuclei's structure. The [pt] fluctuations can be studied via multi-particle pt correlations; so far, only the lowest four orders have been studied. Higher-order fluctuations can provide stronger constraints on the initial conditions and improved sensitivity to the detailed nuclear structure; however, their direct implementation can be challenging and is still lacking. In this paper, we apply a generic recursive algorithm for the genuine multi-particle pt correlations, which enables the accurate study of higher-order [pt] fluctuations without computationally heavy processing for the first time. With this algorithm, we will examine the power of multi-particle pt correlations through Monte Carlo model studies with different nuclear structures. The impact on the nuclear structure studies, including the nuclear deformation and triaxial structure, will be discussed. These results will demonstrate the usefulness of multi-particle pt correlations for studying nuclear structure in high-energy nuclei collisions at RHIC and the LHC, which could serve as complementary to existing low-energy nuclear structure studies.",

        "Abstract": "Hyperon ($Y=Œ£,Œõ$)-nucleon ($N=n,p$) interactions are crucial for understanding the existence of neutron stars heavier than two solar masses. Amid renewed experimental efforts, we study $YN$ scatterings from the perspective of quantum information, focusing on whether spin entanglement is suppressed in the s-wave channel, which is observed in $np$ scattering and leads to enhanced global symmetries. Using global fits of phase shifts from experimental data, we find hints of entanglement suppression among the eight flavor channels in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, similar to the $np$ case. One exception is the $Œ£^+p$ channel, where conflicting global fits lead to inconclusive outcome. We then propose ''quantum'' observables in $Œ£^+p$ scattering to help resolve the differing global fits.",

Isospin diffusion is studied using the evolution of the isospin transport ratio with centrality. The asymmetry parameter $Œ¥=(N-Z)/A$ of the quasiprojectile (QP) residue is used as isospin-sensitive observable, while a recent method for impact parameter reconstruction is used for centrality sorting.A benchmark of global observables is proposed to assess the relevance of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, coupled to GEMINI++, in the study of dissipative collisions. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering cluster formation to reproduce observables used for isospin transport and centrality studies.Within the AMD model, we prove the applicability of the impact parameter reconstruction method, enabling a direct comparison to the experimental data for the investigation of isospin diffusion.For both, we evidence a tendency to isospin equilibration with an impact parameter decreasing from $9$ to $3$ fm, while the full equilibration is not reached.A weak sensitivity to the stiffness of the equation of state employed in the model is also observed, with a better reproduction of the experimental trend for the neutron-rich reactions.",

        "Authors": "Niklas G√∂tz, Lucas Constantin, Hannah Elfner",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this work is to study the effect of exchanging initial condition models in a modular hybrid approach. The focus lies on the event-by-event correlations of elliptic and triangular flow. This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. The initial condition models investigated are SMASH IC, Trento and IP-Glasma. Correlations are calculated on an event-by-event basis between the eccentricities and momentum anisotropies of the initial state as well as the momentum anisotropies in the final state, both for ultra-central and off-central collisions for AuAu collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. This work demonstrates that, although averaged values for the eccentricities of these models are very similar, substantial differences exist both in the distributions of eccentricities, the correlations amongst the initial state properties as well as in the correlations between initial state and final state properties. Notably, whereas initial state momentum anisotropy is shown to not affect the final state flow, the presence of radial flow affects the emergence of final state momentum anisotropies. Inclusion of radial flow in the linear fit improves the prediction of final state flow from initial state properties. The presence of momentum in the initial state has an effect on the emergence of flow and is therefore a relevant part of initial state models, challenging the common understanding of final state momentum anisotropies being a linear response to initial state eccentricity only.",

        "Authors": "Rong An, Xiang Jiang, Na Tang, Li-Gang Cao, Feng-Shou Zhang",
        "Abstract": "Charge radii measured with high accuracy provide a stringent benchmark for characterizing nuclear structure phenomena. In this work, the systematic evolution of charge radii for nuclei with $Z=19$-$29$ is investigated through relativistic mean field (RMF) theory with effective forces NL3, PK1 and NL3$^{*}$. The neutron-proton ($np$) correlation around Fermi surface originated from the unpaired neutron and proton has been taken into account tentatively in order to reduce the overestimated odd-even staggering (OES) of charge radii. This improved method can give an available description of charge radii across $N=28$ shell closure. A remarkable observation is that the charge radii beyond $N=28$ shell closure follow the similarly steep increasing trend, namely irrespective of the number of protons in the nucleus. Especially, the latest results of charge radii for nickel and copper isotopes can be reproduced remarkably well. Along $N=28$ isotonic chain, the sudden increase of charge radii is weakened across $Z=20$, but presented evidently across $Z=28$ closed shell. The abrupt changes of charge radii across $Z=22$ are also shown along $N=32$ and $34$ isotones, but latter with a less slope. This seems to provide a sensitive indicator to identify the new magicity of a nucleus with universal trend of charge radii.",

        "Authors": "Wojciech Brylinski, Marek Gazdzicki, Francesco Giacosa, Mark Gorenstein, Roman Poberezhnyuk, Subhasis Samanta, Herbert Stroebele",
        "Abstract": "It is well known that isospin symmetry is fulfilled to a good approximation in strong interactions, as confirmed in low-energy scattering experiments and in mass spectra of both light and heavy hadrons. In collisions of nuclei with an equal number of protons and neutrons, isospin symmetry imposes that the number of produced charged kaons should equal the number of neutral ones. The NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN recently reported an excess of charged over neutral kaon production in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Here, we argue that the measured charge-to-neutral kaon ratio of about 1.2 indicates an unexpectedly large violation of isospin symmetry. Using well-established models for hadron production, we demonstrate that known symmetry-breaking effects and the initial nuclei containing more neutrons than protons lead only to a small (few per cent) deviation from unity at high energies. Thus, they cannot explain the measurements. The significance of the isospin symmetry violation beyond the known effects is 5.5$ \\cdot œÉ$ when errors quoted by the experiments are used and 8.1$ \\cdot œÉ$ for the PDG-like scaled errors. New systematic, high-precision measurements and theoretical efforts are needed to establish the origin of the observed large isospin-symmetry breaking.",

        "Abstract": "The heaviest chemical elements are naturally produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) during neutron star mergers or supernovae. The r-process production of elements heavier than uranium (transuranic nuclei) is poorly understood and inaccessible to experiments, so must be extrapolated using nucleosynthesis models. We examine element abundances in a sample of stars that are enhanced in r-process elements. The abundances of elements Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag (atomic numbers Z = 44 to 47, mass numbers A = 99 to 110) correlate with those of heavier elements (63 <= Z <= 78, A > 150). There is no correlation for neighboring elements (34 <= Z <= 42 and 48 <= Z <= 62). We interpret this as evidence that fission fragments of transuranic nuclei contribute to the abundances. Our results indicate that neutron-rich nuclei with mass numbers >260 are produced in r-process events.",

The model calculations are done using a (3+1)-dimensional hybrid framework, incorporating both hydrodynamic evolution and hadronic transport that is calibrated to agree with bulk observables including the elusive rapidity differential $v_1$ of light-flavor hadrons. We find that the late stage hadronic rescattering phase causes significant qualitative modification of the $K^{*0}$ $v_1$ resulting in $\\frac{dv_1}{dy}(K^{*0})-\\frac{dv_1}{dy}(K^{+})$ and $\\frac{dv_1}{dy}(œÜ)-\\frac{dv_1}{dy}(K^{+})$ to have opposite signs with the effect being more pronounced in central collisions as compared to peripheral ones due to the larger multiplicity as well as longer duration of the hadronic phase. Further, this effect is enhanced in low-energy collisions owing to a stronger breaking of boost invariance. On the contrary, the influence of the hadronic phase on the $K^{*0}$ elliptic flow $v_2$ is found to be less significant and quantitative.",

        "Abstract": "A series of relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials for two-nucleon system, denoted as OBEP$Œõ$, is constructed with a momentum cutoff $Œõ$ ranging from $\\infty$ to 2 fm$^{-1}$. These potentials are developed by simultaneous fitting to nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) scattering phase shifts, low-energy scattering length, effective range, and the binding energy of the deuteron. The momentum-space matrix elements of the low-momentum OBEP$Œõ$ ($Œõ\\leqslant 3$ fm$^{-1}$) demonstrate consistency with the universal behaviors observed in other realistic $NN$ potentials evolved by renormalization group methods. These OBEP$Œõ$s are applied to calculate the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) within either the nonrelativistic (NR) Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) or relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) frameworks. The results show that the saturation properties of SNM are reproduced qualitatively from the RBHF calculation, but not from the NR-BHF calculation. This study highlights the relativistic mechanism in explaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The remaining discrepancy in reproducing empirical saturation properties in the RBHF calculation using the OBEP$Œõ$s signals the necessity of including three-nucleon correlations or genuine three-nucleon forces.",

It has been pointed out by Caron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from the phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via unitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that the phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by performing a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to calculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of this method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form factor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.",

We find that the TQRPA approach produces not only a higher total luminosity of electron neutrinos (mainly born in the electron capture reaction), compared to the standard technique based on the large-scale shell model (LSSM) weak-interaction rates, but also a harder neutrino spectrum. Besides, applying the TQRPA and LSSM, we find that in the context of electron antineutrino generation, the neutral-current nuclear de-excitation (ND) process via neutrino-antineutrino pair emission is at least as important as the electron-positron pair annihilation process. We also show that flavor oscillations enhance the high-energy contribution of the ND process to the electron antineutrino flux. This could potentially be important for pre-supernova antineutrino registration by the Earth's detectors.",

        "Authors": "Latsamy Xayavong, Yeunhwan Lim",
        "Abstract": "The isospin-symmetry breaking correction, denoted as $Œ¥_C$, is introduced for the first time within the shell-model framework to the nuclear matrix element of Gamow-Teller transitions. $Œ¥_C$ is separated into two components: the isospin mixing term, $Œ¥_{C1}$, induced by the Coulomb and nuclear charge-dependent forces in the effective Hamiltonian, and the radial mismatch term, $Œ¥_{C2}$, arising from differences between proton and neutron realistic wave functions. Consequently, the refinement strategy developed for superallowed $0^+\\rightarrow 0^+$ Fermi transitions is applied to Gamow-Teller transitions as well. It is demonstrated that, to a given precision level, the shell model calculation of $Œ¥_C$ converges much faster than the calculation of the transition matrix element. Furthermore, higher-order correction terms are investigated and considered for consistent study of our works. Various interesting properties of the leading correction terms are discovered within the two-level model and parentage expansion of the one-body transition densities in angular momentum and isospin spaces. One such property is the dependence of $Œ¥_{C1}$ on the isospin admixture amplitude, $Œ±$, starting from the first order, while the same model yields $Œ¥_{C1} = Œ±^2$ for Fermi transitions. The calculated $Œ¥_C$ values are then utilized to evaluate the mirror asymmetry of Gamow-Teller transition strengths, which are compared with available experimental data and other theoretical calculations. Due to the refined fitting procedure of the Woods-Saxon potential parameters and the improved convergence as a function of intermediate state number, our results show better agreement on average compared to those of Smirnova and Volpe [Nucl. Phys. {\\bf A 714}, 441 (2003)].",

For a large set of far-off-equilibrium initial conditions the system exhibits a peculiar phenomenon where its total equilibrium entropy decreases with time. Using a non-equilibrium definition of entropy based on Boltzmann's H-function, we demonstrate how this apparently anomalous behavior is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. We also use the H-function to formulate `maximum-entropy' hydrodynamics, a far-off-equilibrium macroscopic theory that can describe both free-streaming and near-equilibrium regimes of quark-gluon plasma in a single framework.",

        "Abstract": "The ENDF-6 format, widely used worldwide for storing and disseminating nuclear data, is managed by the Cross Sections Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) and fully documented in the ENDF-6 formats manual. This manual employs a combination of formal and natural language, introducing the possibility of ambiguity in certain parts of the format specification. To eliminate the possibility of ambiguity, this contribution proposes a generalization of the formal language used in the ENDF-6 formats manual, which is precisely defined in extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF). This formalization also offers several other advantages, notably reducing the complexity of creating and updating parsing and validation programs for ENDF-6 formatted files. Moreover, the availability of a formal description enables the automatic mapping of the low-level ENDF-6 representation, provided by a sequence of numbers, to a more human-friendly hierarchical representation with variable names. Demonstrating these advantages, almost the entire ENDF-6 format description has been translated into the proposed formal language, accompanied by a reference implementation of a parser/translator. This implementation leverages the formal format specification to enable reading, writing, and validating ENDF-6 formatted files.",

We derive the $Œ±$-nucleus potential by a folding procedure with the point-nucleon density obtained by a microscopic mean-field model using the present DD-$Œ±N$ interaction. The density dependence of the DD-$Œ±N$ interaction is fixed phenomenologically to reproduce the $Œ±$-nucleus elastic scattering cross-section data by the $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{58}$Ni, $^{90}$Zr, and $^{208}$Pb targets at $E/A =$ 10--342.5 MeV. We also show the total reaction cross sections, which are helpful in fixing one free parameter, the renormalization factor for the imaginary part of the $Œ±$-nucleus potential.

        "Abstract": "A neutron star harbors of order $10^{56}$ electrons in its core, and almost the same number of muons, with muon decay prohibited by Pauli blocking. However, as macroscopic properties of the star such as its mass, rotational velocity, or magnetic field evolve over time, the equilibrium lepton abundances (dictated by the weak interactions) change as well. Scenarios where this can happen include spin-down, accretion, magnetic field decay, and tidal deformation. We discuss the mechanisms by which a star disrupted in one of these ways re-establishes lepton chemical equilibrium. In most cases, the dominant processes are out-of-equilibrium Urca reactions, the rates of which we compute for the first time. If, however, the equilibrium muon abundance decreases, while the equilibrium electron abundance increases (or decreases less than the equilibrium muon abundance), outward diffusion of muons plays a crucial role as well. This is true in particular for stars older than about 10,000 yrs whose core has cooled to $\\lesssim 20$ keV. The muons decay in a region where Pauli blocking is lifted, and we argue that these decays lead to a flux of $\\mathcal{O}$(10 MeV) neutrinos. Realistically, however, this flux will remain undetectable for the foreseeable future.",

        "Abstract": "Using a general-order many-body Green's-function method for molecules, we numerically illustrate three pathological behaviors of the Feynman-Dyson diagrammatic perturbation expansion of one-particle many-body Green's functions as electron propagators. First, the perturbation expansion of the frequency-dependent self-energy is nonconvergent at the exact self-energy in many frequency domains. Second, the Dyson equation with an odd-order self-energy has a qualitatively wrong shape and, as a result, most of their satellite roots are complex and nonphysical. Third, the Dyson equation with an even-order self-energy has an exponentially increasing number of roots as the perturbation order is raised, which quickly exceeds the correct number of roots. Infinite partial summation of diagrams by vertex or edge modification exacerbates these problems. Not only does the nonconvergence render higher-order perturbation theories useless for satellite roots, but it also calls into question the validity of their combined use with the ans√§tze requiring the knowledge of all poles and residues. Such ans√§tze include the Galitskii-Migdal identity, self-consistent Green's-function methods, Luttinger-Ward functional, and some models of the algebraic diagrammatic construction.",

We consider two light quark flavors and current-current interactions in the scalar-pseudoscalar, vector, and diquark pairing channels, where the nonlocality of the currents is taken into account by a Gaussian form factor that depends on the spatial components of the 4-momentum. Within this framework, we analyze order parameters, critical temperatures, phase diagrams, equation of state, and mass-radius relations for different temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials. For parameters of the model that are constrained by recent multi-messenger observations of neutron stars, we find that the mass-radius diagram for isothermal hybrid star sequences exhibits the thermal twin phenomenon for temperatures above 30 MeV.",

In the case of nucleons, we evaluate the spin relaxation rate in the $s$-channel resonance approximation, based on the known experimental data on $Œî$-resonances. We also estimate the spin relaxation rate for $Œõ$-baryons, based on experimental inputs and theoretical models for the low-energy $Œõ$$œÄ$ scattering, including the chiral perturbation theory.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate the effect of chiral mixing on dilepton production by combining the in-medium spectral function in the chiral effective field theory with the state-of-the-art fluid dynamical simulations. We compare the spectral functions with different chiral symmetry restoration scenarios. We find that the scenario with proper chiral symmetry restoration that takes into account the degenerate $œÅ$ and $a_1$ mesons leads to an increase of the yield in the window of $1.1<M<1.4$ GeV. Whereas, the low-temperature theorem of chiral mixing extrapolated toward a chiral crossover, often used in the literature, leads to a substantial overestimate at $M=1.2$ GeV.",

        "Authors": "Saurabh V. Kadam",
        "Abstract": "Double beta decays are rare nuclear processes that can occur in two modes: two-neutrino double beta decay, observed in the Standard Model, and neutrinoless double beta decay, a hypothetical process with profound implications for Particle Physics. To draw reliable conclusions from their experimental constraints, it is necessary to have accurate predictions of the underlying hadronic interactions described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a non-Abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group SU(3). QCD predictions require non-perturbative methods for calculating observables, and lattice QCD (LQCD), a numerical method based on QCD formulated on a finite space-time grid, is the only reliable first-principles technique for obtaining quantitative results. However, LQCD needs formal prescriptions to match numerical results with observables. This thesis provides such prescriptions for double beta decays using the finite volume effects in the LQCD framework. Matching relations that connect two-nucleon double beta decay amplitudes to quantities accessible via LQCD calculations, namely the nuclear matrix elements and two-nucleon energy spectra in a finite volume are provided. The impact of uncertainties is examined on the precision with which low-energy constants of the corresponding effective field theories can be determined from future LQCD calculations.\n  Hamiltonian simulation of QCD is another non-perturbative method of solving QCD which can be more suitable in some cases than the conventional LQCD. The rise of tensor network methods and quantum simulation has made Hamiltonian simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) a reality. Towards the goal of simulating QCD, a loop-string-hadron (LSH) formulation of an SU(3) LGT with matter in 1+1 dimensions is developed in this thesis, motivated by recent studies that showed the LSH formulation of an SU(2) LGT to be advantageous over other formulations.",

        "Authors": "Fabrizio Murgana, Vincenzo Greco, Marco Ruggieri, Dario Zappal√†",
        "Abstract": "We investigate the thermodynamic geometry of the quark-meson model at finite temperature, $T$, and quark number chemical potential, $Œº$. We extend previous works by the inclusion of fluctuations exploiting the functional renormalization group approach. We use recent developments to recast the flow equation into the form of an advection-diffusion equation. We adopt the local potential approximation for the effective average action. We focus on the thermodynamic curvature, $R$, in the $(Œº,T)$ plane, in proximity of the chiral crossover, up to the critical point of the phase diagram. We find that the inclusion of fluctuations results in a smoother behavior of $R$ near the chiral crossover. Moreover, for small $Œº$, $R$ remains negative, signaling the fact that bosonic fluctuations reduce the capability of the system to completely overcome the fermionic statistical repulsion of the quarks. We investigate in more detail the small $Œº$ region by analyzing a system in which we artificially lower the pion mass, thus approaching the chiral limit in which the crossover is actually a second order phase transition. On the other hand, as $Œº$ is increased and the critical point is approached, we find that $R$ is enhanced and a sign change occurs, in agreement with mean field studies. Hence, we completely support the picture that $R$ is sensitive to a crossover and a phase transition, and provides information about the effective behavior of the system at the phase transition.",

        "Abstract": "Recent LHCb data for $B^-\\to J/œàŒõ\\bar{p}$ show a clear peak structure at the $Œû_c\\bar{D}$ threshold in the $J/œàŒõ$ invariant mass ($M_{J/œàŒõ}$) distribution. The LHCb's amplitude analysis identified the peak with the first hidden-charm pentaquark with strangeness $P_{œàs}^Œõ(4338)$. We conduct a coupled-channel amplitude analysis of the LHCb data by simultaneously fitting the $M_{J/œàŒõ}$, $M_{J/œà\\bar{p}}$, $M_{Œõ\\bar{p}}$, and $\\cosŒ∏_{K^*}$ distributions. Rather than the Breit-Wigner fit employed in the LHCb analysis, we consider relevant threshold effects and a unitary $Œû_c\\bar{D}$-$Œõ_c\\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel scattering amplitude from which $P_{œàs}^Œõ$ poles are extracted for the first time. In our default fit, the $P_{œàs}^Œõ(4338)$ pole is almost a $Œû_c \\bar{D}$ bound state at $( 4338.2\\pm 1.4)-( 1.9\\pm 0.5 )\\,i$ MeV.

We also found that the $P_{œàs}^Œõ(4338)$ peak cannot solely be a kinematical effect, and a nearby pole is needed.",

        "Authors": "L. Lotina, K. Nomura",
        "Abstract": "The hexadecapole deformation, as well as the quadrupole one, influences the low-lying states of finite nuclei. The hexadecapole correlations are often overshadowed by the large quadrupole effects, and hence have not been much investigated. Here we address the relevance of hexadecapole deformations in the calculations of low-energy collective states of heavy nuclei using the theoretical framework of the self-consistent mean-field method and the interacting-boson approximation. The interacting-boson Hamiltonian that explicitly includes the quadrupole and hexadecapole collective degrees of freedom is specified by a choice of a universal energy density functional and pairing interaction. In an illustrative application to axially-deformed Gd isotopes, it is shown that the inclusion of the hexadecapole degree of freedom does not affect most of the low-spin and low-lying states qualitatively, but that has notable effects in that it significantly improves the description of high-spin states of the ground-state bands of nearly spherical vibrational nuclei, and that gives rise to $K^œÄ=4^+$ bands exhibiting strong $E4$ transitions in strongly deformed nuclei.",

Furthermore, we explore the possibility of a superdeformed configuration in $^{28}$Si. Our calculations, spanning both the $sd$ and $pf$ shells, rule out the existence of a superdeformed $0^+$ bandhead within an excitation energy range of 10-20 MeV.",

We study the effects of varying both the initial momentum-space anisotropy and initialization times using an exact solution of the 0+1D boost-invariant Boltzmann equation with a mass- and temperature-dependent relaxation time. Our findings support the existence of a longitudinal pressure attractor, but they do not support the existence of distinct attractors for the bulk viscous and shear pressures. Considering a large set of integral moments, we show that for moments with greater than one power of longitudinal momentum squared, both early- and late-time attractors are present.",

By explicitly incorporating one-pion exchange, the approach quantitatively accounts for effects related to left-hand cuts and range corrections from the longest-range interactions. The method utilizes the plane wave basis instead of the conventional partial wave expansion, thereby also naturally including partial wave mixing effects resulting from rotational symmetry breaking in a cubic box. Applied to the lattice data for $DD^*$ scattering at a pion mass of 280 MeV, it reveals the significant impact of the one-pion exchange on P-wave and S-wave phase shifts. The pole position of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ state, extracted from the finite-volume energy levels while taking into account left-hand cut effects, range corrections, and partial-wave mixing, appears to be consistent with a near-threshold resonance.",

In this paper, we investigate in more details the convergence of FAM calculations of the response function as a function of the parameters controlling the numerical implementation of the theory.

However, the restoration of broken symmetries is eventually mandatory to recover the corresponding quantum numbers and to achieve a more precise description of nuclear properties.\n  While symmetry-restored calculations are routinely performed to study ground-state properties and low-lying excitations, similar applications to the nuclear response are essentially limited to either formal studies or to schematic models. In the present paper, the effect of angular momentum restoration on the monopole and quadrupole responses of doubly open-shell nuclei is investigated.\n  Based on deformed Skyrme-Random Phase Approximation (RPA) calculations, the exact Angular Momentum Projection (AMP) is implemented in the calculation of the multipole strength functions, thus defining a projection after variation (PAV-RPA) scheme. The method is employed for the first time in a realistic study to investigate the effect of AMP on the coupling of monopole and quadrupole modes in $^{24}$Mg resulting from its intrinsic deformation.",

Our analysis reveals that the mathematical structure of the ISL equations is akin to that of moment equations, enabling them to approximately replicate even the collisionless dynamics. We conclude that this particular feature is important in extending the applicability of ISL theories beyond the hydrodynamic regime.",

        "Abstract": "The ATLAS collaboration has recently observed that the variance of the transverse momentum per particle ($[ p_t ]$), when measured as a function of the collision multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) in Pb+Pb collisions, decreases by a factor $2$ for the largest values of $N_{ch}$, corresponding to ultra-central collisions. We show that this phenomenon is naturally explained by invoking impact parameter ($b$) fluctuations, which contribute to the variance, and gradually disappear in ultra-central collisions. It implies that $N_{ch}$ and $[ p_t ]$ are strongly correlated at fixed $b$, which is explained by the local thermalization of the QGP medium.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, a method was developed for implementing arbitrary short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations in Monte Carlo sampled nuclei (as well as deformations of the 1-body nuclear density). We use this method to implement realistic 2-body correlations in a sample of nuclei for use in simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and we quantify the statistical benefits. These results demonstrate that the method can be used to easily implement an arbitrary correlation function, and systematically study the effects of correlations using significantly less resources than is necessary with traditional methods.",

The excitation function of the $Œõ$ polarization shows a significant splitting between polarizations of $Œõ$ and $\\barŒõ$, which challenges a widespread interpretation that the splitting is affected mainly by the late-stage magnetic field.",

        "Abstract": "Backdoor attacks, representing an emerging threat to the integrity of deep neural networks, have garnered significant attention due to their ability to compromise deep learning systems clandestinely. While numerous backdoor attacks occur within the digital realm, their practical implementation in real-world prediction systems remains limited and vulnerable to disturbances in the physical world. Consequently, this limitation has given rise to the development of physical backdoor attacks, where trigger objects manifest as physical entities within the real world. However, creating the requisite dataset to train or evaluate a physical backdoor model is a daunting task, limiting the backdoor researchers and practitioners from studying such physical attack scenarios. This paper unleashes a recipe that empowers backdoor researchers to effortlessly create a malicious, physical backdoor dataset based on advances in generative modeling. Particularly, this recipe involves 3 automatic modules: suggesting the suitable physical triggers, generating the poisoned candidate samples (either by synthesizing new samples or editing existing clean samples), and finally refining for the most plausible ones. As such, it effectively mitigates the perceived complexity associated with creating a physical backdoor dataset, transforming it from a daunting task into an attainable objective. Extensive experiment results show that datasets created by our \"recipe\" enable adversaries to achieve an impressive attack success rate on real physical world data and exhibit similar properties compared to previous physical backdoor attack studies. This paper offers researchers a valuable toolkit for studies of physical backdoors, all within the confines of their laboratories.",

Formally, assuming an $\\varepsilon$-thin domain and anisotropic viscosities with vertical viscosity $ŒΩ_z=\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^Œ≥)$ where $Œ≥=2$, one obtains the primitive equations with full viscosity as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$. Here, we take two more limit equations into consideration: For $Œ≥<2$ the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. For $Œ≥>2$ the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity $-Œî_H$ as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$. Thus, there are three possible limits of the hydrostatic approximation depending on the assumption on the vertical viscosity. The latter convergence has been proven recently by Li, Titi, and Yuan using energy estimates. Here, we consider more generally $ŒΩ_z=\\varepsilon^2 Œ¥$ and show how maximal regularity methods and quadratic inequalities can be an efficient approach to the same end for $\\varepsilon,Œ¥\\to 0$. The flexibility of our methods is also illustrated by the convergence for $Œ¥\\to \\infty$ and $\\varepsilon\\to 0$ to the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations.",

        "Abstract": "If a two-level system coupled to a single-mode cavity is strongly driven by an external laser, instead of a continuous accumulation of photons in the cavity, oscillations in the mean photon number occur. These oscillations correspond to peaks of finite width running up and down in the photon number distribution, reminiscent of wave packets in linear chain models. A single wave packet is found if the cavity is resonant to the external laser. Here, we show that for finite detuning multiple packet structures can exist simultaneously, oscillating at different frequencies and amplitudes. We further study the influence of dissipative effects resulting in the formation of a stationary state, which depending on the parameters can be characterized by a bimodal photon number distribution. While we give analytical limits for the maximally achievable photon number in the absence of any dissipation, surprisingly, dephasing processes can push the photon occupations towards higher photon numbers.",

        "Abstract": "A time-dependent potential barrier has been used to probe the arrival-time distribution of the wave packet of a hot electron by raising the barrier to block the packet upon arrival of the packet at the barrier. To see whether the barrier precisely detects the distribution, it is necessary to study an error caused by a finite rising speed of the barrier. For this purpose, we study transmission of an electron wave packet through the dynamical barrier, and identify two regimes, the semiclassical regime and the quasistatic regime. In each regime, we calculate the arrival-time distribution reconstructed by using the barrier and quantify the error in the detection, the difference of the temporal uncertainty between the wave-packet distribution and the reconstructed distribution. Our finding suggests that for precise detection, the time scale, in which the barrier height rises over the energy distribution of the wave packet and the tunneling energy window of the barrier, has to be much shorter than the temporal uncertainty of the wave packet. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical calculations.",

In this paper we consider a triggering process of reconnection that is driven by interaction of two discontinuities: solar wind rotational discontinuity and tangential discontinuity at the Earth's magnetospheric boundary, magnetopause. Combining the multispacecraft measurements and global hybrid simulations, we show that solar wind discontinuities may drive the magnetopause reconnection and cause the mixing of the solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas around the magnetopause, well downstream of the solar wind flow. Since large-amplitude discontinuities are frequently observed in the solar wind and predicted for various stellar winds, our results of reconnection driven by the discontinuity-discontinuity interaction may have a broad application beyond the magnetosphere.",

        "Abstract": "Anomalous high energy photons, known as GRB221009A, with 18 TeV and 251 TeV were observed by LHAASO and Carpet-2 recently. Such observation of high energy gamma-ray bursts from distant source causes a mystery since high energy photons suffer severe attenuation before reaching the earth. One possibility is the existence of axion-like particles (ALP), and high energy photons at the source can convert to these ALPs which travel intergalactically. In this paper, we study the effects of extra dimensions on the conversion probability between photon and ALPs. The conversion probability saturates and may reach almost $100\\%$ for high energy photons. We show that the size of extra dimension affects the energy at which saturation occurs. The observations of high-energy photons may support the possibility of smaller extra dimension.",

        "Abstract": "The freezing of a sessile droplet unveils fascinating physics, characterised by the emergence of a frost halo on the underlying substrate, the progression of the liquid-ice interface, and the formation of a cusp-like morphology at the tip of the droplet. We investigate the freezing of a volatile sessile droplet, focusing on the frost halo formation, which has not been theoretically explored. The formation of the frost halo is associated with the inherent evaporation process in the early freezing stages. We observe a negative evaporation flux enveloping the droplet in the initial stages, which indicates that vapour produced during freezing condenses on the substrate close to the contact line, forming a frost halo. The condensate accumulation triggers re-evaporation, resulting in a temporal shift of the frost halo region away from the contact line. Eventually, it disappears due to the diffusive nature of the water vapour far away from the droplet. We found that increasing the relative humidity increases the lifetime of the frost halo due to a substantial reduction in evaporation that prolonged the presence of net condensate on the substrate. Increasing liquid volatility increases the evaporation flux, and condensation occurs closer to the droplet, as a higher amount of vapour is in the periphery of the droplet. We also found that decreasing the thermal conductivity of the substrate increases the total freezing time. The slower freezing process is accompanied by increased vaporized liquid, resulting in condensation with its concentration reaching supersaturation.",

        "Abstract": "We present a new hydrodynamic scheme named Godunov Density-Independent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (GDISPH), that can accurately handle shock waves and contact discontinuities without any manually tuned parameters. This is in contrast to the standard formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SSPH), which requires the parameters for an artificial viscosity term to handle the shocks and struggles to accurately handle the contact discontinuities due to unphysical repulsive forces, resulting in surface tension that disrupts pressure equilibrium and suppresses fluid instabilities. While Godunov SPH (GSPH) can handle the shocks without the parameters by using solutions from a Riemann solver, it still cannot fully handle the contact discontinuities. Density-Independent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (DISPH), one of several schemes proposed to handle contact discontinuities more effectively than SSPH, demonstrates superior performance in our tests involving strong shocks and contact discontinuities. However, DISPH still requires the artificial viscosity term. We integrate the Riemann solver into DISPH in several ways, yielding some patterns of GDISPH. The results of standard tests such as the one-dimensional Riemann problem, pressure equilibrium, Sedov-Taylor, and Kelvin-Helmholtz tests are favourable to GDISPH Case 1 and GDISPH Case 2, as well as DISPH. We conclude that GDISPH Case 1 has an advantage over GDISPH Case 2, effectively handling shocks and contact discontinuities without the need for specific parameters or kernels and without introducing any additional numerical diffusion.",

It has been pointed out by Caron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from the phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via unitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that the phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by performing a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to calculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of this method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form factor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.",

We establish the foundations and methodology for an ongoing educational experiment to investigate the question \"From what age can students learn quantum theory if taught using a diagrammatic approach?\". We anticipate that the primary benefit of leveraging such a diagrammatic approach, which is conceptually intuitive yet mathematically rigorous, will be eliminating some of the most daunting barriers to teaching and learning this subject while enabling young learners to reason proficiently about high-level problems. We posit that transitioning from symbolic presentations to pictorial ones will increase the appeal of STEM education, attracting more diverse audience.",

We outline an approach to the general conjecture and prove many special cases and partial results using tools developed in the companion paper, following the proof of the original conjecture by Schiffmann-Vasserot and its generalization to divisors in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ by Rapcak-Soibelman-Yang-Zhao.\n  The vertex algebras $\\mathbb{V}(Y,S)$ conjecturally include $W$-superalgebras $ W_{f_0,f_1}^Œ∫(\\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ and genus zero class $\\mathcal{S}$ chiral algebras $\\mathbb{V}^{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\text{Gl}_m;f_1,...,f_k}$, each for general nilpotents $f_i$. By definition, this implies the existence of a family of compatible free field realizations of these vertex algebras, relevant to their parabolic induction and inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction.

The design is based on a dielectric membrane with a buried quantum well and restricts the electron and hole wave functions to the area of the optical hotspot in order to overcome the challenge of co-locating an optical cavity with a quantum emitter. Combined with proper surface passivation, this geometry points towards the deterministic fabrication of functional quantum dots in optical cavities by lithographic means.",

        "Authors": "Daniel Shen, Marija Ilic",
        "Abstract": "Owners of wind power plants are exposed to financial risk in wholesale electricity markets due to the uncertain nature of wind forecasts and price volatility. In the event of a wind shortfall, the plant may have to repurchase power at a higher price in the real-time market. However, reducing the power offered in the day-ahead market may also be interpreted by regulators as physical withholding. We formulate and solve a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that prices the uncertain portion of a wind generator's forecast to hedge against uncertainties and which addresses concerns around withholding. We exploit the structure of the MIQP inputs to introduce additional constraints to improve computation time. Additionally, we provide a qualitative approach for generators and regulators to interpret the results of the MIQP. Finally, we simulate a real-world application for a wind farm in New York using past wind forecasts and NYISO prices.",

        "Abstract": "DarkSide-20k is a next-generation dual-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, currently under construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. With a 20 t fiducial mass of liquid Argon, DarkSide-20k will probe WIMP-nucleon interactions down to cross sections equal to 10$^{-48}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 0.1 TeV/c$^2$. DarkSide-20k is designed to be a nearly \"instrumental background-free\" experiment, meaning that less than 0.1 background events are expected in the WIMP search region during the 200 tonne-year planned exposure. To achieve this, the TPC is surrounded by an inner (neutron) and outer (muon) veto, while low-radioactivity underground argon (depleted in $^{39}$Ar), is used as the inner detector (TPC and inner veto) medium. Both the TPC and the veto systems are instrumented with novel cryogenic silicon photomultiplier, capable of resolving single photoelectrons and providing the required spatial and time resolution. An overview of the DarkSide-20k experimental program is reported, with a focus on the photo-detector system construction and testing procedures for the inner veto system.",

Laflamme to derive the thermofield double state for a causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_Œ≤\\times \\mathbb{R}$, where $Œ≤$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_Œ≤$ is the one-dimensional sphere (circle). The temperature detected by a static diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature derived via this path integral procedure.",

        "Abstract": "Radiotherapy using very-high-energy electron (VHEE) beams (50-300 MeV) has attracted considerable attention due to its advantageous dose deposition characteristics, enabling deep penetration and the potential for ultra-high dose rate treatment. One promising approach to compactly delivering these high energy electron beams in a cost-effective manner is laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), which offers ultra-strong accelerating gradients. However, the transition from this concept to a functional machine intended for tumor treatment is still being investigated. Here we present the first self-developed prototype for LWFA-based VHEE radiotherapy, exhibiting high compactness (occupying less than 5 square meters) and high operational stability (validated over a period of one month). Subsequently, we employed this device to irradiate a tumor implanted in a mouse model. Following a dose delivery of $5.8\\pm0.2$ Gy with precise tumor conformity, all irradiated mice exhibited pronounced control of tumor growth. For comparison, this tumor-control efficacy was similar to that achieved using commercial X-ray radiotherapy equipment operating at equivalent doses. These results demonstrate the potential of a compact laser-driven VHEE system for preclinical studies involving small animal models and its promising prospects for future clinical translation in cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "The quantum dynamics of a low-dimensional system in contact with a large but finite harmonic bath is theoretically investigated by coarse-graining the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. In this model, the couplings between the system and the bath are obtained from the statistical average over the discrete, degenerate effective states. Our model is aimed at intermediate bath sizes in which non-Markovian processes and energy transfer between the bath and the main system are important. The method is applied to a model system of a Morse oscillator coupled to 40 harmonic modes. The results are found to be in excellent agreement with the direct quantum dynamics simulations of Bouakline et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 116, 11118-11127 (2012)], but at a much lower computational cost. Extension to larger baths is discussed in comparison to the time-convolutionless method. We also extend this study to the case of a microcanonical bath with finite initial internal energies. The computational efficiency and convergence properties of the effective bath states model with respect to relevant parameters are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "We show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional insulator, when subjected to an external superlattice potential forms a new paradigm for electrostatically tunable excitons in the near- and mid-ultraviolet (UV). The imposed potential has three consequences: (i) it renormalizes the effective mass tensor, leading to anisotropic effective masses; (ii) it renormalizes the band gap, eventually reducing it; (iii) it reduces the exciton binding energies. All these consequences depend on a single dimensionless parameter, which includes the product of strength of the external potential with its period. In addition to the excitonic energy levels, we compute the optical conductivity along two orthogonal directions, and from it the absorption spectrum. The results for the latter show that our system is able to mimic a grid polarizer. These characteristics make one-dimensional hBN superlattices a viable and unexplored platform for fine-tuned polaritonics in the UV to visible spectral range.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of material databases provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover predictive descriptors for emergent material properties from vast data space. However, common reliance on high-throughput ab initio data necessarily inherits limitations of such data: mismatch with experiments. On the other hand, experimental decisions are often guided by an expert's intuition honed from experiences that are rarely articulated. We propose using machine learning to \"bottle\" such operational intuition into quantifiable descriptors using expertly curated measurement-based data. We introduce \"Materials Expert-Artificial Intelligence\" (ME-AI) to encapsulate and articulate this human intuition. As a first step towards such a program, we focus on the topological semimetal (TSM) among square-net materials as the property inspired by the expert-identified descriptor based on structural information: the tolerance factor. We start by curating a dataset encompassing 12 primary features of 879 square-net materials, using experimental data whenever possible. We then use Dirichlet-based Gaussian process regression using a specialized kernel to reveal composite descriptors for square-net topological semimetals. The ME-AI learned descriptors independently reproduce expert intuition and expand upon it. Specifically, new descriptors point to hypervalency as a critical chemical feature predicting TSM within square-net compounds. Our success with a carefully defined problem points to the \"machine bottling human insight\" approach as promising for machine learning-aided material discovery.",

We particularly show that the presence of edge modes is not justified by gauge invariance of the presymplectic form, but rather by the condition that the presymplectic form is degenerate on the initial field space, which allows to relate this presymplectic form to the symplectic form on the gauge reduced field space via pullback.",

The method combines the advantages of the phase field method for multi-phase flow simulation and the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for an explicit description of the elastic surface. The model is thermodynamically consistent, coupling bulk hydrodynamics with capillary forces, as well as bending, tension, and stretching of a thin membrane. The method is validated by comparing simulations for single droplets to theoretical results of shape equations, and its capabilities are illustrated in 2D and 3D axisymmetric scenarios.",

Then, we put the proposed scheme to the test by employing an age-based epidemiological compartment model introduced in a previous work of the authors, coupled with data from the literature, in order to compare the effectiveness of age-based and horizontal interventions. In general, our results suggest that these two are comparable mainly at low or medium level of austerity.",

They are commonly described by two distinct spacetime metrics, one of local Lipschitz regularity, the other one even distributional. These two metrics are thought to be `physically equivalent' since they can be formally related by a `discontinuous coordinate transformation'. In this paper we provide a mathematical analysis of this issue for the entire class of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in a background spacetime of constant curvature. We devise a natural geometric regularisation procedure to show that the notorious change of variables arises as the distributional limit of a family of smooth coordinate transformations. In other words, we establish that both spacetimes arise as distributional limits of a smooth sandwich wave taken in different coordinate systems which are diffeomorphically related.",

        "Abstract": "Efficiently creating a concise but comprehensive data set for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is an under-explored problem. Active learning (AL), which uses either biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD simulations, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. Simultaneously exploring both regions is necessary for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. In this work, we demonstrate that MD simulations, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, effectively capture extrapolative regions and rare events without the need to know \\textit{a priori} the system's transition temperatures and pressures. Exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD simulations by introducing the concept of bias stress. We also employ calibrated ensemble-free uncertainties derived from sketched gradient features to yield MLIPs with similar or better accuracy than ensemble-based uncertainty methods at a lower computational cost. We use the proposed uncertainty-driven AL approach to develop MLIPs for two benchmark systems: alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al). Compared to MLIPs trained with conventional MD simulations, MLIPs trained with the proposed data-generation method more accurately represent the relevant configurational space for both atomic systems.",

        "Authors": "Balt C. van Rees, Xiang Zhao",
        "Abstract": "We consider the behavior of the OPE density $c(Œî,\\ell)$ for conformal four-point functions in the flat-space limit where all scaling dimensions become large. We find evidence that the density reduces to the partial waves $f_\\ell(s)$ of the corresponding scattering amplitude. The Euclidean inversion formula then reduces to the partial wave projection and the Lorentzian inversion formula to the Froissart-Gribov formula. The flat-space limit of the OPE density can however also diverge, and we delineate the domain in the complex $s$ plane where this happens. Finally we argue that the conformal dispersion relation reduces to an ordinary single-variable dispersion relation for scattering amplitudes.",

        "Abstract": "The summational invariant and the corresponding local Maxwellian that are compatible with the Enskog equation are discussed, with special interest in the presence of a boundary. The local Maxwellian corresponding to the summational invariant is restrictive compared to the case of the Boltzmann equation in the sense that a radial flow and time-dependent temperature are forbidden. However, a rigid body rotation with a constant angular velocity is admitted as in the case of the Boltzmann equation. The influence of the presence of a boundary is also discussed in simple situations.",

        "Authors": "Shuo Tian, Bin Li, Yejing Dai",
        "Abstract": "Ultrahigh electrostrains (greater than 1%) in several piezoceramic systems have been reported since 2022, which attract more and more interest in the field of piezoelectricity; however, the mechanism is still unclear. Here, we have directly observed a novel electric field-induced bending (electrobending) phenomenon that visually exhibites as an alternating concave-convex deformation under an electric field of plus or minus 50 kV cm-1, in nonstoichiometric (K0.48Na0.52)0.99NbO2.995 ceramics, which causes the measured ultrahigh electrostrain. It is demonstrated that the electrobending deformation arises from the different stresses due to the stretching or compression of the defect dipoles on the upper and lower surfaces of the ceramics. As a result of the large electrobending deformation, a giant apparent electrostrain of 11.6% is obtained at room temperature, and it can even reach up to 26.0% at 210 degree Celsius, which far exceeds that of all present piezoelectric materials. Our discovery is an important addition and refinement to the field of condensed matter physics, whilst providing a new strategy and shedding light on the design of future precision actuators or intelligent devices.",

        "Abstract": "Nonlinear response signatures are increasingly recognized as useful probes of condensed matter systems, in particular for characterisation of topologically non-trivial states. The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is particularly useful in study of topological semimetals, as the CPGE tensor quantises for well-isolated topological degeneracies in strictly linearly-dispersing band structures. Here, we study multiplicative Weyl semimetal band-structures, and find that the multiplicative structure robustly protects the quantization of the CPGE even in the case of non-linear dispersion. Computing phase diagrams as a function of Weyl node tilting, we find a variety of quantised values for the CPGE tensor, revealing that the CPGE is also a useful tool in detecting and characterising parent topology of multiplicative topological states.",

        "Abstract": "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the importance of accurately forecasting contagion dynamics and learning infection parameters into sharp focus. At the same time, effective policy-making requires knowledge of the uncertainty on such predictions, in order, for instance, to be able to ready hospitals and intensive care units for a worst-case scenario without needlessly wasting resources. In this work, we apply a novel and powerful computational method to the problem of learning probability densities on contagion parameters and providing uncertainty quantification for pandemic projections. Using a neural network, we calibrate an ODE model to data of the spread of COVID-19 in Berlin in 2020, achieving both a significantly more accurate calibration and prediction than Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based sampling schemes. The uncertainties on our predictions provide meaningful confidence intervals e.g. on infection figures and hospitalisation rates, while training and running the neural scheme takes minutes where MCMC takes hours. We show convergence of our method to the true posterior on a simplified SIR model of epidemics, and also demonstrate our method's learning capabilities on a reduced dataset, where a complex model is learned from a small number of compartments for which data is available.",

Our AlGaN ring resonators demonstrate tunability and high Q-factors due to the low-loss waveguiding.

        "Abstract": "This article introduces a novel Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm and cost-effective hardware for long-term operational stability measurements in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Harnessing the untapped potential of solar energy sources is crucial for achieving a sustainable future, and accurate MPPT is vital to maximizing power generation. However, existing MPPT algorithms for classical photovoltaic technology lead to suboptimal performance and decreased energy efficiency conversion when applied to the most stable perovskite devices, the so-called triple mesoscopic hole transport material (HTM)-free metal halide PSCs. To address this challenge, our research focuses on developing an innovative low-cost hardware solution for research purposes that enables massive long-term stability measurements, eliminating the need for expensive and complex stability monitoring systems. Our galvanostatic MPPT algorithm ensures continuous and precise tracking achieving superior operational performance for high hysteresis PSCs. The suggested enhancements bear significant implications for the extensive integration of perovskite solar cell technologies, particularly those dependent on power optimizer devices.",

In particular, despite \"wrong\" signs in the DBI action for the two-time de Sitter case, the theories have the same S-matrix. This is consistent with the expectation that effective field theories are determined solely by their degrees of freedom and pattern of symmetry breaking, even in the case of spacetime symmetries.

        "Abstract": "We consider the application of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) methods to a class of canonical Hamiltonian PDE systems involving differential forms. Solutions to these systems satisfy a local multisymplectic conservation law, which generalizes the more familiar symplectic conservation law for Hamiltonian systems of ODEs, and which is connected with physically-important reciprocity phenomena, such as Lorentz reciprocity in electromagnetics. We characterize hybrid FEEC methods whose numerical traces satisfy a version of the multisymplectic conservation law, and we apply this characterization to several specific classes of FEEC methods, including conforming Arnold-Falk-Winther-type methods and various hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. Interestingly, the HDG-type and other nonconforming methods are shown, in general, to be multisymplectic in a stronger sense than the conforming FEEC methods. This substantially generalizes previous work of McLachlan and Stern [Found. Comput. Math., 20 (2020), pp. 35-69] on the more restricted class of canonical Hamiltonian PDEs in the de Donder-Weyl \"grad-div\" form.",

In this work, we consider the problem of jointly estimating the states and sparse inputs of such systems from low-dimensional (compressive) measurements. Due to the low-dimensional measurements, conventional Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms fail to accurately estimate the states and inputs. We present a Bayesian approach that exploits the input sparsity to significantly improve estimation accuracy. Sparsity in the input estimates is promoted by using different prior distributions on the input. We investigate two main approaches: regularizer-based MAP, and {Bayesian learning-based estimation}. We also extend the approaches to handle control inputs with common support and analyze the time and memory complexities of the presented algorithms. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and time/memory complexities, especially in the low-dimensional measurement regime.",

Using an analytical empirical formula, we show that the lifetime of the ion ensemble $t_0$ under cold condition increases with $q_x$ according to a power law $t_0\\propto q_x^A$, and does not vary significantly for the several ion quantities $N$ tested. The temperature of the explosive onset $B$ decreases linearly with $q_x$.

The eigenvalue problem is then solved on a classical computer, yielding approximations to ground- and excited-state energies and wavefunctions. QSMs are examples of hybrid quantum-classical methods, where a quantum device supported by classical computational resources is employed to tackle a problem. QSMs are rapidly gaining traction as a strategy to simulate electronic wavefunctions on quantum computers, and thus their design, development, and application is a key research field at the interface between quantum computation and electronic structure. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to QSMs, with emphasis on their application to the electronic structure of molecules. We present the theoretical foundations and applications of QSMs, and we discuss their implementation on quantum hardware, illustrating the impact of noise on their performance.",

Although the current method demonstrates the possibility of quantum k-means clustering, it does not ensure high accuracy and consistency across a wide range of datasets. The existing coreset techniques are designed for classical algorithms and there has been no quantum-tailored coreset technique which is designed to boost the accuracy of quantum algorithms. In this work, we propose solving the k-means clustering problem with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and a customised coreset method, the Contour coreset, which has been formulated with specific focus on quantum algorithms. Extensive simulations with synthetic and real-life data demonstrated that our VQE+Contour Coreset approach outperforms existing QAOA+Coreset k-means clustering approaches with higher accuracy and lower standard deviation. Our work has shown that quantum tailored coreset techniques has the potential to significantly boost the performance of quantum algorithms when compared to using generic off-the-shelf coreset techniques.",

        "Abstract": "The linewidth of a laser plays a pivotal role in ensuring high fidelity of ion trap quantum processors and optical clocks. As quantum computing endeavors scale up, the demand for higher laser power with ultra-narrow linewidth becomes imperative, and leveraging fiber amplifiers emerges as a promising approach to meet these requirements. This study explores the effectiveness of Thulium-doped fiber amplifiers as a viable solution for addressing optical qubit transitions in trapped barium ion qubits. We demonstrate that by performing high-fidelity gates on the qubit while introducing minimal intensity noise, TDFAs do not significantly broaden the linewidth of the seed lasers. We employed a Voigt fitting scheme in conjunction with a delayed self-heterodyne method to accurately measure the linewidth independently, corroborating our findings through quadrupole spectroscopy with trapped barium ions. Our results show linewidth values of $\\sim$ $160$~Hz and $156$~Hz, respectively, using these two methods, underscoring the reliability of our measurement techniques. The slight variation between the two methods may be attributed to factors such as amplified spontaneous emission in the TDFA or the influence of $1/f$ noise within the heterodyne setup delay line. These contribute to advancing our understanding of laser linewidth control in the context of ion trap quantum computing as well as stretching the availability of narrow linewidth, high-power tunable lasers beyond the C-band.",

        "Abstract": "Device-independent quantum secure direct communication (DI-QSDC) is a promising primitive in quantum cryptography aimed towards addressing the problems of device imperfections and key management. However, significant effort is required to tackle practical challenges such as the distance limitation due to decohering effects of quantum channels. Here, we explore the constructive effect of non-Markovian noise to improve the performance of DI-QSDC. Considering two different environmental dynamics modeled by the amplitude damping and the dephasing channels, we show that for both cases non-Markovianty leads to a considerable improvement over Markovian dynamics in terms of three benchmark performance criteria of the DI-QSDC task. Specifically, we find that non-Markovian noise (i) enhances the protocol security measured by Bell-violation, (ii) leads to a lower quantum bit error rate, and (iii) enables larger communication distances by increasing the capacity of secret communication.",

        "Abstract": "The Tavis-Cummings model is a paradigmatic central-mode model where a set of two-level quantum emitters (spins) are coupled to a collective cavity mode. Here we study the eigenstate spectrum, its localization properties and the effect on dynamics, focusing on the two-excitation sector relevant for nonlinear photonics. These models admit two sources of disorder: in the coupling between the spins and the cavity and in the energy shifts of the individual spins. While this model was known to be exactly solvable in the limit of a homogeneous coupling and inhomogeneous energy shifts, we here establish the solvability in the opposite limit of a homogeneous energy shift and inhomogeneous coupling, presenting the exact solution and corresponding conserved quantities. We identify three different classes of eigenstates, exhibiting different degrees of multifractality and semilocalization closely tied to the integrable points, and study their stability to perturbations away from these solvable points. The dynamics of the cavity occupation number away from equilibrium, exhibiting boson bunching and a two-photon blockade, is explicitly related to the localization properties of the eigenstates and illustrates how these models support a collective spin description despite the presence of disorder.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for state transfer under trace-preserving transformations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT). Under these free transformations, we show that logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

        "Abstract": "Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers have been essential for advancing fundamental research and technological applications. Ti:Sa lasers are unmatched in bandwidth and tuning range, yet their use is severely restricted due to their large size, cost, and need for high optical pump powers. Here, we demonstrate a monocrystalline Ti:Sa-on-insulator (Ti:SaOI) photonics platform which enables dramatic miniaturization, cost-reduction, and scalability of Ti:Sa technology. First, through fabrication of low-loss whispering gallery mode resonators, we realize a Ti:Sa laser operating with an ultra-low lasing threshold of 290 $Œº$W. Then, through orders-of-magnitude improvement in mode confinement in Ti:SaOI waveguides, we realize the first integrated solid-state (i.e., non-semiconductor) optical amplifier operating below 1 $Œº$m, with an ultra-wide bandwidth of 700 - 950 nm and peak gain of 64 dB/cm. We demonstrate unprecedented 17 dB distortion-free amplification of picosecond pulses to up to 2.3 nJ pulse energy, corresponding to a peak power of 1.0 kW. Finally, we demonstrate the first tunable integrated Ti:Sa laser, featuring narrow linewidths and a 24.7 THz tuning range, which, for the first time, can be pumped with low-cost, miniature, off-the-shelf green laser diodes. This opens doors to new modalities of Ti:Sa lasers (now occupying a footprint less than 0.15 mm$^2$), such as massively-scalable Ti:Sa laser array systems for a variety of applications. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we employ a Ti:SaOI laser array as the sole optical control for a cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment with artificial atoms in silicon carbide. This work is a key step towards the democratization of Ti:Sa technology through a three orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and footprint, as well as the introduction of solid-state broadband amplification of sub-micron wavelength light.",

        "Abstract": "We present two families of quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing a general physical process. These QSLs were obtained using Schatten $Œ±$-norms, firstly exploiting the geometric features of the space of quantum states endowed with some inner product, and secondly employing the Holder's inequality for matrix norms. In particular, for the case of single-qubit states, we find that the geometric QSL is independent of the Schatten norm chosen, thus revealing a universality behavior of such quantifiers. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of these quantum speed limits with existing paradigmatic QSLs in literature, thus showing that the latter results represent particular cases of a general class of QSLs related to Schatten $Œ±$-norms. Noteworthy, we address necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightness of the quantum speed limit that mostly depends on the populations and quantum coherences of the evolved single-qubit state, and also present a geometric interpretation for these set of conditions. Finally, we compare the two QSL obtained for the dynamics of single-qubit states, also presenting an inequality between them that has a clear geometrical meaning.",

        "Abstract": "We develop and implement an exact conical intersection nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics method that combines the local diabatic representation, Strang splitting for the total molecular propagator, and discrete variable representation with uniform grids. By employing the local diabatic representation, this method captures all non-adiabatic effects, including nonadiabatic transitions, electronic coherences, and geometric phases. Moreover, it is free of singularities in the first and second derivative couplings, and does not require a smooth gauge of electronic wavefunction phase. We further show that in contrast to the adiabatic representation, the split-operator method can be directly applied to the full molecular propagator with the locally diabatic ansatz. The Fourier series, employed as the primitive nuclear basis functions, is universal and can be applied to all types of reactive coordinates. The combination of local diabatic representation, Strang splitting, and Fourier basis allows exact modeling of conical intersection quantum dynamics directly with adiabatic electronic states that can be obtained from standard electronic structure computations.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate a practical application of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms to enhance subroutines in the Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio optimization model. As a proof of concept, we implement a 12-qubit example for selecting 6 assets out of a 12-asset pool. Our approach involves predicting investor views with quantum machine learning (QML) and addressing the subsequent optimization problem using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The solutions obtained from VQE exhibit a high approximation ratio behavior, and consistently outperform several common portfolio models in backtesting over a long period of time. A unique aspect of our VQE scheme is that after the quantum circuit is optimized, only a minimal number of samplings is required to give a high approximation ratio result since the probability distribution should be concentrated on high-quality solutions. We further emphasize the importance of employing only a small number of final samplings in our scheme by comparing the cost with those obtained from an exhaustive search and random sampling. The power of quantum computing can be anticipated when dealing with a larger-size problem due to the linear growth of the required qubit resources with the problem size. This is in contrast to classical computing where the search space grows exponentially with the problem size and would quickly reach the limit of classical computers.",

        "Authors": "Paul M. Alsing, Carlo Cafaro, Domenico Felice, Orlando Luongo",
        "Abstract": "When studying the geometry of quantum states, it is acknowledged that mixed states can be distinguished by infinitely many metrics. Unfortunately, this freedom causes metric-dependent interpretations of physically significant geometric quantities such as complexity and volume of quantum states. In this paper, we present an insightful discussion on the differences between the Bures and the Sj√∂qvist metrics inside a Bloch sphere. First, we begin with a formal comparative analysis between the two metrics by critically discussing three alternative interpretations for each metric. Second, we illustrate explicitly the distinct behaviors of the geodesic paths on each one of the two metric manifolds. Third, we compare the finite distances between an initial and final mixed state when calculated with the two metrics. Interestingly, in analogy to what happens when studying topological aspects of real Euclidean spaces equipped with distinct metric functions (for instance, the usual Euclidean metric and the taxicab metric), we observe that the relative ranking based on the concept of finite distance among mixed quantum states is not preserved when comparing distances determined with the Bures and the Sj√∂qvist metrics. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion on the consequences of this violation of a metric-based relative ranking on the concept of complexity and volume of mixed quantum states.",

        "Abstract": "Generating entanglement between distributed network nodes is a prerequisite for the quantum internet. Entanglement distribution protocols based on high-dimensional photonic qudits enable the simultaneous generation of multiple entangled pairs, which can significantly reduce the required coherence time of the qubit registers. However, current schemes require fast optical switching, which is experimentally challenging. In addition, the higher degree of error correlation between the generated entangled pairs in qudit protocols compared to qubit protocols has not been studied in detail. We propose a qudit-mediated entangling protocol that completely circumvents the need for optical switches, making it more accessible for current experimental systems. Furthermore, we quantify the amount of error correlation between the simultaneously generated entangled pairs and analyze the effect on entanglement purification algorithms and teleportation-based quantum error correction. We find that optimized purification schemes can efficiently correct the correlated errors, while the quantum error correction codes studied here perform worse than for uncorrelated error models.",

Of particular interest here are the Toeplitz and Fej√©r-Riesz operator systems, which are, respectively, operator systems of Toeplitz matrices and Laurent polynomials (that is, trigonometric polynomials), and which are related in the operator system category through duality. Some notable categorical relationships established in this paper are the C$^*$-nuclearity of Toeplitz and Fej√©r-Riesz operator systems, as well as their unique operator system structures when tensoring with injective operator systems. Among the results of this study are two of independent interest: (i) a matrix criterion, similar to the one involving the Choi matrix, for a linear map of the Fej√©r-Riesz operator system to be completely positive; (ii) a completely positive extension theorem for positive linear maps of $n\\times n$ Toeplitz matrices into arbritary von Neumann algebras, thereby showing that a similar extension theorem of Haagerup for $2\\times 2$ Toeplitz matrices holds for Toeplitz matrices of higher dimension.",

These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R√©nyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.",

        "Abstract": "We show through numerical simulation that the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for higher-order, random-coefficient, heavy-hex compatible spin glass Ising models has strong parameter concentration across problem sizes from $16$ up to $127$ qubits for $p=1$ up to $p=5$, which allows for straight-forward transfer learning of QAOA angles on instance sizes where exhaustive grid-search is prohibitive even for $p>1$. We use Matrix Product State (MPS) simulation at different bond dimensions to obtain confidence in these results, and we obtain the optimal solutions to these combinatorial optimization problems using CPLEX. In order to assess the ability of current noisy quantum hardware to exploit such parameter concentration, we execute short-depth QAOA circuits (with a CNOT depth of 6 per $p$, resulting in circuits which contain $1420$ two qubit gates for $127$ qubit $p=5$ QAOA) on $100$ higher-order (cubic term) Ising models on IBM quantum superconducting processors with $16, 27, 127$ qubits using QAOA angles learned from a single $16$-qubit instance. We show that (i) the best quantum processors generally find lower energy solutions up to $p=3$ for 27 qubit systems and up to $p=2$ for 127 qubit systems and are overcome by noise at higher values of $p$, (ii) the best quantum processors find mean energies that are about a factor of two off from the noise-free numerical simulation results. Additional insights from our experiments are that large performance differences exist among different quantum processors even of the same generation and that dynamical decoupling significantly improve performance for some, but decrease performance for other quantum processors. Lastly we show $p=1$ QAOA angle mean energy landscapes computed using up to a $414$ qubit quantum computer, showing that the mean QAOA energy landscapes remain very similar as the problem size changes.",

We introduce a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented, while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling.

        "Abstract": "Having previously been the subject of decades of semiconductor research, cadmium arsenide has now reemerged as a topological material, realizing ideal three-dimensional Dirac points at the Fermi level. These topological Dirac points lead to a number of extraordinary transport phenomena, including strong quantum oscillations, large magnetoresistance, ultrahigh mobilities, and Fermi velocities exceeding graphene. The large mobilities persist even in thin films and nanowires of cadmium arsenide, suggesting the involvement of topological surface states. However, computational studies of the surface states in this material are lacking, in part due to the large 80-atom unit cell. Here we present the computed Fermi arc surface states of a cadmium arsenide thin film, based on a tight-binding model derived directly from the electronic structure. We show that despite the close proximity of the Dirac points, the Fermi arcs are very long and straight, extending through nearly the entire Brillouin zone. The shape and spin properties of the Fermi arcs suppress both back- and side- scattering at the surface, which we show by explicit integrals over the phase space. The introduction of a small symmetry-breaking term, expected in a strong electric field, gaps the electronic structure, creating a weak topological insulator phase that exhibits similar transport properties. Crucially, the mechanisms suppressing scattering in this material differ from those in other topological materials such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators, suggesting a new route for engineering high-mobility devices based on Dirac semimetal surface states.",

        "Authors": "Sangbae Kim, Byoung S. Ham",
        "Abstract": "Super-resolution overcoming the standard quantum limit has been intensively studied for quantum sensing applications of precision target detection over the last decades. Not only higher-order entangled photons but also phase-controlled coherent photons have been used to demonstrate the super-resolution. Due to the extreme inefficiency of higher-order entangled photon-pair generation and ultralow signal-to-noise ratio, however, quantum sensing has been severely limited. Here, we report observations of coherently excited super-resolution using phase-controlled coherent photons in a delayed-choice quantum eraser scheme. Using phase manipulations of the quantum erasers, super-resolution has been observed for higher-order intensity correlations between them, satisfying the Heisenberg limit in phase resolution. This new type of precision phase-detection technique opens the door to practical applications of quantum sensing compatible with current technologies based on coherence optics.",

It is also expressed by using Sandwitched relative entropy. We prove various properties of the $Œ±$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $Œ±$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. The generalized quantum relative entropies play a central role in many areas of quantum information theory, and we provide a connection of these entropic quantities to thermodynamic properties.",

Unlike previous quantum-secured protocols that impose a threshold error rate limiting their operation, even with the existence of true signals, our approach not only identifies spoofing attacks but also facilitates the reconstruction of a true image. Our method involves the analysis of a specific mode correlation of a photon-pair, which is independent of the mode used for image construction, to check security. Through this analysis, we can identify both the targeted image region by the attack and the type of spoofing attack, enabling reconstruction of the true image. A proof-of-principle demonstration employing polarization-correlation of a photon-pair is provided, showcasing successful image reconstruction even under the condition of spoofing signals 2000 times stronger than the true signals. We expect our approach to be applied to quantum-secured signal processing such as quantum target detection or ranging.",

        "Abstract": "Chiral excitation flows have drawn a lot of attention for their unique unidirectionality. Such flows have been studied in three-node networks with synthetic gauge fields (SGFs), while they are barely realized as the number of nodes increases. In this work, we propose a scheme to achieve chiral flows in $n$-node networks, where an auxiliary node is introduced to govern the system. This auxiliary node is coupled to all the network nodes, forming sub-triangle structures with interference paths in these networks. We find the implicit chiral symmetry behind the perfect chiral flow and propose the universal criteria that incorporate previous models, facilitating the implementation of chiral transmission in various networks. By investigating the symmetries within these models, we present different features of the chiral flow in bosonic and spin networks. Furthermore, we extend the four-node model into a ladder network, which is promising for remote state transfer in practical systems with less complexity. Our scheme can be realized in state-of-the-art experimental systems, such as superconducting circuits and magnetic photonic lattices, thereby opening up new possibilities for future quantum networks.",

With the increasing the tilting angle the type of the gas-supersolid transition changes from the first order to the second one despite the 2D character of the system, whereas the anisotropy and many-body stabilizing interactions play crucial role. Our approach is based on the numerical analysis of the phase diagram using the simulated annealing method for a free-energy functional. The predicted supersolid effect can be realized in a variety of experimental setups ranging from excitons in heterostructures to cold atoms and polar molecules in optical potentials.",

Remarkably, in a $p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction, three distinct phases emerge: the topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the trivial phase devoid of MBS. When MBS appear, surface odd-$ŒΩ$ spin-triplet pairing is induced only in the topological regime. In contrast, surface-induced even-frequency (even-$ŒΩ$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the existence of MBS. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced surface odd-$ŒΩ$ spin triplet superconductivity.",

An instantaneous, gauge invariant phase is introduced for arbitrary paths in nuclear configuration space in terms of hydrodynamical variables, and shown to reduce to the adiabatic geometric phase when the state is adiabatic and the path is closed. The evolution of the closed-path phase over time is shown to adhere to a Maxwell-Faraday induction law, with non-conservative forces arising from the electron dynamics that play the role of electromotive forces. We identify the pivotal forces that are able to change the value of the phase, thereby challenging any topological argument. Nonetheless, negligible changes in the phase occur when the local dynamics along the probe loop is approximately adiabatic. In other words, the adiabatic idealization of geometric phase effects may remain suitable for effectively describing certain dynamic observables.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated the absence of certain bright peaks in Autler-Townes laser excitation spectra of alkali metal atoms. Our research revealed that these dips in the spectra are caused by a specific architecture of adiabatic (or ``laser-dressed'') states in hyperfine (HF) components. The dressed states' analysis pinpointed several cases where constructive and destructive interference between HF excitation pathways in a two-photon excitation scheme limits the available two-photon transitions. This results in a reduction of the conventional two-photon selection rule for the total angular momentum $F$, from $ŒîF= 0,\\pm 1$ to $ŒîF\\equiv 0$. Our discovery presents practical methods for selectively controlling the populations of unresolvable HF $F$-components of $ns_{1/2}$ Rydberg states in alkali metal atoms. Using numerical simulations with sodium and rubidium atoms, we demonstrate that by blocking the effects of HF interaction with a specially tuned auxiliary control laser field, the deviations from the ideal selectivity of the HF components population can be lower than $0.01\\%$ for Na and $0.001\\%$ for Rb atoms.",

Central to our investigation is the consideration of the full vectorial attributes of the magnetic fields involved, which are a \\textit{dc} field for lifting the degeneracy of the spin levels and an \\textit{ac} field for microwave control between two spin levels. We observe an intricate interdependence between their spatial orientations, the externally applied strain, and the resultant efficacy in spin state control. In most work to date the \\textit{ac} and \\textit{dc} magnetic field orientations have been insufficiently addressed, which has led to the conclusion that strain is indispensable for the effective microwave control of heavier group-IV vacancies, such as tin- and lead-vacancy color centers. In contrast, we find that the alignment of the \\textit{dc} magnetic field orthogonal to the symmetry axis and the \\textit{ac} field parallel to it can make the application of strain obsolete for effective spin manipulation. Furthermore, we explore the implications of this field configuration on the spin's optical initialization, readout, and gate fidelities.",

        "Abstract": "Quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to display a spectrum whose fine-grained features (gaps and correlations) are well described by Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We propose and develop a complementary version of this conjecture: quantum chaotic systems display a Lanczos spectrum whose local means and covariances are well described by RMT. To support this proposal, we first demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems. We then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and covariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time behavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor, as well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with continuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time averages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean Lanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the statistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum chaos. Finally, we clarify the relation between spread complexity and the universality classes of RMT by exploring various values of the Dyson index and Poisson distributed spectra.",

In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates are close to the breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods. Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a single device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits. Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits, termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor. This thesis provides a detailed introduction to the superconducting qudit and demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of decoherence in an artificial atom with more than two levels using Lindblad master equations and stochastic master equations (SMEs). After extending the theory of the design, control, and readout of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, the thesis focuses on modeling the dispersive measurement of a transmon qutrit in an open quantum system using quadrature detections. Under the Markov assumption, master equations with different levels of abstraction are proposed and solved; in addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of decoherence analysis are presented and compared analytically and numerically. The thesis ends with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type qutrit, verifying the validity of the stochastic model.",

        "Abstract": "Electrons in materials containing heavy elements are fundamentally relativistic and should in principle be described using the Dirac equation. However, the current standard for treatment of electrons in such materials involves density functional theory methods originally formulated from the Schr√∂dinger equation. While some extensions of the Schr√∂dinger-based formulation have been explored, such as the scalar relativistic approximation with or without spin-orbit coupling, these solutions do not provide a way to fully account for all relativistic effects of electrons, and the language used to describe such solutions are still based in the language of the Schr√∂dinger equation. In this article, we provide a different method for translating between the Dirac and Schr√∂dinger viewpoints in the context of a Coulomb potential. By retaining the Dirac four-vector notation and terminology in taking the non-relativistic limit, we see a much deeper connection between the Dirac and Schr√∂dinger equation solutions that allow us to more directly compare the effects of relativity in the angular and radial functions. Through this viewpoint, we introduce the concepts of densitals and Dirac spherical harmonics that allow us to translate more easily between the Dirac and Schr√∂dinger solutions. These concepts allow us to establish a useful language for discussing relativistic effects in materials containing elements throughout the full periodic table and thereby enable a more fundamental understanding of the effects of relativity on electronic structure.",

        "Abstract": "Free-electron radiation phenomena are treated almost exclusively with classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, creating a small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This phenomenon arises from free-electron elastic recoil, which can influence fundamental radiation processes in ways thought so far to necessitate inelastic scattering. The underlying reason for the quantum radiation features, which have no counterparts in classical theory, is the entanglement between each elastically recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. We show that this phenomenon is more accessible than all other types of quantum features in free-electron radiation and can be detected in current experimental setups such as electron microscopes. These quantum radiation features could guide the development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and quantum optics.",

        "Abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are essential to guarantee information-theoretic security in quantum communication. Although there was some previous work on quantum group key distribution, they still face many challenges under a ``\\textit{dynamic}'' group communication scenario. In particular, when the group keys need to be updated in real-time for each user joining or leaving to ensure secure communication properties, i.e., forward confidentiality and backward confidentiality. However, current protocols require a large amount of quantum resources to update the group keys, and this makes them impractical for handling large and dynamic communication groups. In this paper, we apply the notion of ``{\\em tree key graph}'' to the quantum key agreement and propose two dynamic Quantum Group Key Agreement (QGKA) protocols for a join or leave request in group communications. In addition, we analyze the quantum resource consumption of our proposed protocols. The number of qubits required per join or leave only increases logarithmically with the group size. As a result, our proposed protocols are more practical and scalable for large and dynamic quantum group communications.",

        "Abstract": "Facilitating the ability to achieve logical qubit error rates below physical qubit error rates, error correction is anticipated to play an important role in scaling quantum computers. While many algorithms require millions of physical qubits to be executed with error correction, current superconducting qubit systems contain only hundreds of physical qubits. One of the most promising codes on the superconducting qubit platform is the surface code, requiring a realistically attainable error threshold and the ability to perform universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with local operations via lattice surgery and magic state injection. Surface code architectures easily generalize to single-chip planar layouts, however space and control hardware constraints point to limits on the number of qubits that can fit on one chip. Additionally, the planar routing on single-chip architectures leads to serialization of commuting gates and strain on classical decoding caused by large ancilla patches. A distributed multi-chip architecture utilizing the surface code can potentially solve these problems if one can optimize inter-chip gates, manage collisions in networking between chips, and minimize routing hardware costs. We propose QuIRC, a superconducting Quantum Interface Routing Card for Lattice Surgery between surface code modules inside of a single dilution refrigerator. QuIRC improves scaling by allowing connection of many modules, increases ancilla connectivity of surface code lattices, and offers improved transpilation of Pauli-based surface code circuits. QuIRC employs in-situ Entangled Pair (EP) generation protocols for communication. We explore potential topological layouts of QuIRC based on superconducting hardware fabrication constraints, and demonstrate reductions in ancilla patch size by up to 77.8%, and in layer transpilation size by 51.9% when compared to the single-chip case.",

This suggests that the study of the ``subadditivity cone'', and the set of its extreme rays realizable in quantum mechanics, provides a powerful new tool for deriving inner bounds for the quantum and stabilizer entropy cones, as well as constraints on new inequalities for the von Neumann entropy.",

        "Abstract": "Predicting the properties of strongly correlated materials is a significant challenge in condensed matter theory. The widely used dynamical mean-field theory faces difficulty in solving quantum impurity models numerically. Hybrid quantum--classical algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolver emerge as a potential solution for quantum impurity models. A common challenge in these algorithms is the rapid growth of the number of variational parameters with the number of spin-orbitals in the impurity. In our approach to this problem, we develop compact ansatzes using a combination of two different strategies. First, we employ compact physics-inspired ansatz, $k$-unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz, developed in the field of quantum chemistry. Second, we eliminate largely redundant variational parameters of physics-inspired ansatzes associated with bath sites based on physical intuition. This is based on the fact that a quantum impurity model with a star-like geometry has no direct hopping between bath sites. We benchmark the accuracy of these ansatzes for both ground-state energy and dynamic quantities by solving typical quantum impurity models with/without shot noise. The results suggest that we can maintain the accuracy of ground-state energy while we drop the number of variational parameters associated with bath sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moment expansion, when combined with the proposed ansatzes, can calculate the imaginary-time Green's functions under the influence of shot noise. This study demonstrates the potential for addressing complex impurity models in large-scale quantum simulations with fewer variational parameters without sacrificing accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "Integrated photonics has enabled countless technologies in telecommunications, spectroscopy, metrology, quantum optics, and quantum information processing. Using highly confined guided optical modes is the key that has made integrated circuits possible and has lead to scaling of complex designs, benefiting from their small footprint. At the same time, the field of quantum acoustics has recently gained significant attention due to its various potential advantages over its photonic counterparts, including smaller mode volume, lower energy, and orders of magnitude slower propagation speeds, as well as the potential for interconnecting distinct quantum systems. Developing analogous integrated phononic technology is critical for realizing the full potential of phonons and could lead to groundbreaking new applications, such as scalable quantum computing and hybrid quantum devices. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a crucial component for integrated phononic circuits. Adjusting the length of the coupling region allows to realize phononic beam splitters with varying splitting ratios. By sending a single-phonon Fock state onto one of these phononic splitters, we demonstrate the capability of using the directional coupler directly in the quantum regime. Our work provides an essential step towards an integrated phononic platform for both classical and quantum technologies applications.",

        "Abstract": "Ising machines are purported to be better at solving large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems better than conventional von Neumann computers. However, these Ising machines are widely believed to be heuristics, whose promise is observed empirically rather than obtained theoretically. We bridge this gap by considering an opto-electronic oscillator based coherent Ising machine, and providing the first analytical proof that under reasonable assumptions, the OEO-CIM is not a heuristic approach. We find and prove bounds on its performance in terms of the expected difference between the objective value at the final iteration and the optimal one, and on the number of iterations required by it. In the process, we emphasise on some of its limitations such as the inability to handle asymmetric coupling between spins, and the absence of external magnetic field applied on them (both of which are necessary in many optimisation problems), along with some issues in its convergence. We overcome these limitations by proposing suitable adjustments and prove that the improved architecture is guaranteed to converge to the optimum of the relaxed objective function.",

Here, we share our perspective on how to create a framework for systematically selecting protein structure prediction problems that are amenable for quantum advantage, and estimate quantum resources for such problems on a utility-scale quantum computer.

Besides being of fundamental interest, steering is relevant to many asymmetric quantum information tasks. Here, we propose a scheme to generate and manipulate Gaussian quantum steering between two spatially distant mechanical modes of two optomechanical cavities coupled via an optical fiber, and driven by blue detuned lasers. In the unresolved sideband regime, we show, under realistic experimental conditions, that strong asymmetric steering can be generated between the two considered modes. Also, we show that one-way steering can be achieved and practically manipulated through the lasers drive powers and the temperatures of the cavities. Further, we reveal that the direction of one-way steering depends on the sign of the difference between the energies of the mechanical modes. Finally, we discuss how to access the generated steering. This work opens up new perspectives for the distribution of long-distance trust which is of great interest in secure quantum communication.",

        "Abstract": "Meta-learning is a powerful approach that exploits historical data to quickly solve new tasks from the same distribution. In the low-data regime, methods based on the closed-form posterior of Gaussian processes (GP) together with Bayesian optimization have achieved high performance. However, these methods are either computationally expensive or introduce assumptions that hinder a principled propagation of uncertainty between task models. This may disrupt the balance between exploration and exploitation during optimization. In this paper, we develop ScaML-GP, a modular GP model for meta-learning that is scalable in the number of tasks. Our core contribution is a carefully designed multi-task kernel that enables hierarchical training and task scalability. Conditioning ScaML-GP on the meta-data exposes its modular nature yielding a test-task prior that combines the posteriors of meta-task GPs. In synthetic and real-world meta-learning experiments, we demonstrate that ScaML-GP can learn efficiently both with few and many meta-tasks.",

Although at the exploration level, some methods are proposed to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, such as tempering, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Rao-redwellization, and scalable methods for better performance, it cannot avoid the stochastic nature of this exploration. We consider the target distribution as a mapping where the infinite-dimensional Eulerian space of the parameters consists of a number of deterministic submanifolds and propose a generalized energy metric, termed weighted Riesz energy, where a number of points is generated through pairwise interactions, to discretize rectifiable submanifolds. We study the properties of the point, called Riesz particle, and embed it into sequential MCMC, and we find that there will be higher acceptance rates with fewer evaluations, we validate it through experimental comparative analysis from a linear Gaussian state-space model with synthetic data and a non-linear stochastic volatility model with real-world data.",

The significance of the estimand lies in its robustness against traditional issues of confounding. We prove that this robustness holds even when the probability distribution of the outcome, conditional on treatment or some other vector of adjusting variables, differs almost arbitrarily from its counterfactual analogue. This paper also examines possible estimators of the functional average, including the sample mid-range, and proposes a new type of bootstrap for robust statistical inference: the Hoeffding bootstrap. After this, the paper explores a new class of variables, the $\\mathcal{U}$ class of variables, that simplifies the estimation of functional averages. This class of variables is also used to establish mean exchangeability in some cases and to provide the results of elementary statistical procedures, such as linear regression and the analysis of variance, with causal interpretations. Simulation evidence is provided. The methods of this paper are also applied to a National Health and Nutrition Survey data set to investigate the causal effect of exercise on the blood pressure of adult smokers.",

        "Abstract": "Spatio-temporal pathogen spread is often partially observed at the metapopulation scale. Available data correspond to proxies and are incomplete, censored and heterogeneous. Moreover, representing such biological systems often leads to complex stochastic models. Such complexity together with data characteristics make the analysis of these systems a challenge. Our objective was to develop a new inference procedure to estimate key parameters of stochastic metapopulation models of animal disease spread from longitudinal and spatial datasets, while accurately accounting for characteristics of census data. We applied our procedure to provide new knowledge on the regional spread of \\emph{Mycobacterium avium} subsp. \\emph{paratuberculosis} (\\emph{Map}), which causes bovine paratuberculosis, a worldwide endemic disease. \\emph{Map} spread between herds through trade movements was modeled with a stochastic mechanistic model. Comprehensive data from 2005 to 2013 on cattle movements in 12,857 dairy herds in Brittany (western France) and partial data on animal infection status in 2,278 herds sampled from 2007 to 2013 were used. Inference was performed using a new criterion based on a Monte-Carlo approximation of a composite likelihood, coupled to a numerical optimization algorithm (Nelder-Mead Simplex-like). Our criterion showed a clear superiority to alternative ones in identifying the right parameter values, as assessed by an empirical identifiability on simulated data. Point estimates and profile likelihoods allowed us to establish the initial state of the system, identify the risk of pathogen introduction from outside the metapopulation, and confirm the assumption of the low sensitivity of the diagnostic test. Our inference procedure could easily be applied to other spatio-temporal infection dynamics, especially when ABC-like methods face challenges in defining relevant summary statistics.",

Current methods tailored to this setting assume that interventions either destroy parent-child relations of the intervened (target) nodes or only alter such relations without modifying the parent sets, even when the intervention targets are unknown. We relax this assumption by proposing a Bayesian method for causal discovery from general interventions, which allow for modifications of the parent sets of the unknown targets. Even in this framework, DAGs and general interventions may be identifiable only up to some equivalence classes. We provide graphical characterizations of such interventional Markov equivalence and devise compatible priors for Bayesian inference that guarantee score equivalence of indistinguishable structures. We then develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to approximate the posterior distribution over DAGs, intervention targets and induced parent sets. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methodology on both simulated and real protein expression data.",

The work is motivated by the analysis of GPS trajectories of fishing vessels collected from regulatory tracking data in the context of marine biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-based fisheries management. We build a low-dimensional latent representation of trajectories using convolutional neural networks as non-linear mapping. This is done by training a conditional variational auto-encoder taking into account covariates. The posterior distributions of the latent representations can be linked to the characteristics of the actual trajectories. The latent distributions of the trajectories are compared with the Bhattacharyya coefficient, which is well-suited for comparing distributions. Using this coefficient, we analyse the variation of the individual behaviour of each vessel during time. For collective behaviour analysis, we build proximity graphs and use an extension of the stochastic block model for multiple networks. This model results in a clustering of the individuals based on their set of trajectories. The application to French fishing vessels enables us to obtain groups of vessels whose individual and collective behaviours exhibit spatio-temporal patterns over the period 2014-2018.",

        "Abstract": "Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) plays a vital role in estimating solar energy resources, which are used to generate sustainable green energy. In order to estimate GHI with high spatial resolution, a quantitative irradiance estimation network, named QIENet, is proposed. Specifically, the temporal and spatial characteristics of remote sensing data of the satellite Himawari-8 are extracted and fused by recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolution operation, respectively. Not only remote sensing data, but also GHI-related time information (hour, day, and month) and geographical information (altitude, longitude, and latitude), are used as the inputs of QIENet. The satellite spectral channels B07 and B11 - B15 and time are recommended as model inputs for QIENet according to the spatial distributions of annual solar energy. Meanwhile, QIENet is able to capture the impact of various clouds on hourly GHI estimates. More importantly, QIENet does not overestimate ground observations and can also reduce RMSE by 27.51%/18.00%, increase R2 by 20.17%/9.42%, and increase r by 8.69%/3.54% compared with ERA5/NSRDB. Furthermore, QIENet is capable of providing a high-fidelity hourly GHI database with spatial resolution 0.02¬∞ * 0.02¬∞(approximately 2km * 2km) for many applied energy fields.",

        "Abstract": "We consider transferability estimation, the problem of estimating how well deep learning models transfer from a source to a target task. We focus on regression tasks, which received little previous attention, and propose two simple and computationally efficient approaches that estimate transferability based on the negative regularized mean squared error of a linear regression model. We prove novel theoretical results connecting our approaches to the actual transferability of the optimal target models obtained from the transfer learning process. Despite their simplicity, our approaches significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression transferability estimators in both accuracy and efficiency. On two large-scale keypoint regression benchmarks, our approaches yield 12% to 36% better results on average while being at least 27% faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Authors": "Kehui Yao, Jingyi Huang, Jun Zhu",
        "Abstract": "Effective management of environmental resources and agricultural sustainability heavily depends on accurate soil moisture data. However, datasets like the SMAP/Sentinel-1 soil moisture product often contain missing values across their spatiotemporal grid, which poses a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel Spatiotemporal Transformer model (ST-Transformer) specifically designed to address the issue of missing values in sparse spatiotemporal datasets, particularly focusing on soil moisture data. The ST-Transformer employs multiple spatiotemporal attention layers to capture the complex spatiotemporal correlations in the data and can integrate additional spatiotemporal covariates during the imputation process, thereby enhancing its accuracy. The model is trained using a self-supervised approach, enabling it to autonomously predict missing values from observed data points. Our model's efficacy is demonstrated through its application to the SMAP 1km soil moisture data over a 36 x 36 km grid in Texas. It showcases superior accuracy compared to well-known imputation methods. Additionally, our simulation studies on other datasets highlight the model's broader applicability in various spatiotemporal imputation tasks.",

        "Authors": "Litu Rout, Yujia Chen, Abhishek Kumar, Constantine Caramanis, Sanjay Shakkottai, Wen-Sheng Chu",
        "Abstract": "Sampling from the posterior distribution poses a major computational challenge in solving inverse problems using latent diffusion models. Common methods rely on Tweedie's first-order moments, which are known to induce a quality-limiting bias. Existing second-order approximations are impractical due to prohibitive computational costs, making standard reverse diffusion processes intractable for posterior sampling. This paper introduces Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL), a novel sampler that offers efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie with a tractable reverse process using second-order approximation. Our theoretical results reveal that the second-order approximation is lower bounded by our surrogate loss that only requires $O(1)$ compute using the trace of the Hessian, and by the lower bound we derive a new drift term to make the reverse process tractable. Our method surpasses SoTA solvers PSLD and P2L, achieving 4X and 8X reduction in neural function evaluations, respectively, while notably enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO benchmarks. In addition, we show STSL extends to text-guided image editing and addresses residual distortions present from corrupted images in leading text-guided image editing methods. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to offer an efficient second-order approximation in solving inverse problems using latent diffusion and editing real-world images with corruptions.",

        "Abstract": "In multivariate functional data analysis, different functional covariates can be homogeneous in some sense. The hidden homogeneity structure is informative about the connectivity or association of different covariates. The covariates with pronounced homogeneity can be analyzed jointly in the same group and this gives rise to a way of parsimoniously modeling multivariate functional data. In this paper, we develop a multivariate functional regression technique by a new regularization approach termed \"coefficient shape alignment\" to tackle the potential homogeneity of different functional covariates. The modeling procedure includes two main steps: first the unknown grouping structure is detected with a new regularization approach to aggregate covariates into disjoint groups; and then a grouped multivariate functional regression model is established based on the detected grouping structure. In this new grouped model, the coefficient functions of covariates in the same homogeneous group share the same shape invariant to scaling. The new regularization approach builds on penalizing the discrepancy of coefficient shape. The consistency property of the detected grouping structure is thoroughly investigated, and the conditions that guarantee uncovering the underlying true grouping structure are developed. The asymptotic properties of the model estimates are also developed. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite-sample properties of the developed methods. The practical utility of the proposed methods is illustrated in an analysis on sugar quality evaluation. This work provides a novel means for analyzing the underlying homogeneity of functional covariates and developing parsimonious model structures for multivariate functional data.",

        "Abstract": "Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) is one of the most popular methods for optimizing black-box functions with noisy observations, due to its simple structure and superior performance. Its empirical successes lead to a natural, yet unresolved question: Is GP-UCB regret optimal? In this paper, we offer the first generally affirmative answer to this important open question in the Bayesian optimization literature. We establish new upper bounds on both the simple and cumulative regret of GP-UCB when the objective function to optimize admits certain smoothness property. These upper bounds match the known minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors independent of the feasible region's dimensionality) for optimizing functions with the same smoothness. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that, with the same level of exploration, GP-UCB can simultaneously achieve optimality in both simple and cumulative regret. The crux of our analysis hinges on a refined uniform error bound for online estimation of functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This error bound, which we derive from empirical process theory, is of independent interest, and its potential applications may reach beyond the scope of this study.",

While the meta-analysis yields quantitative insights (e.g., overall estimates), the enrichment analyses provide user-friendly summaries of qualitative information on the evidence base. Scoping reviews can visualize study characteristics, unravelling knowledge gaps and methodological differences. Bibliometric analysis offers a visual assessment of the non-independent evidence, such as hyper-dominant authors and countries, and funding sources, potentially informing the risk of bias. Impact metric analysis employs alternative metrics to gauge societal influence and research translation (e.g., policy and patent citations) of studies in the meta-analysis. To illustrate the application of this framework, we provide sample visualizations and R code.",

        "Authors": "Soumya Roy, Vinay K Verma, Deepak Gupta",
        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a simple but highly efficient expansion-based model for continual learning. The recent feature transformation, masking and factorization-based methods are efficient, but they grow the model only over the global or shared parameter. Therefore, these approaches do not fully utilize the previously learned information because the same task-specific parameter forgets the earlier knowledge. Thus, these approaches show limited transfer learning ability. Moreover, most of these models have constant parameter growth for all tasks, irrespective of the task complexity. Our work proposes a simple filter and channel expansion based method that grows the model over the previous task parameters and not just over the global parameter. Therefore, it fully utilizes all the previously learned information without forgetting, which results in better knowledge transfer. The growth rate in our proposed model is a function of task complexity; therefore for a simple task, the model has a smaller parameter growth while for complex tasks, the model requires more parameters to adapt to the current task. Recent expansion based models show promising results for task incremental learning (TIL). However, for class incremental learning (CIL), prediction of task id is a crucial challenge; hence, their results degrade rapidly as the number of tasks increase. In this work, we propose a robust task prediction method that leverages entropy weighted data augmentations and the models gradient using pseudo labels. We evaluate our model on various datasets and architectures in the TIL, CIL and generative continual learning settings. The proposed approach shows state-of-the-art results in all these settings. Our extensive ablation studies show the efficacy of the proposed components.",

        "Abstract": "Regularization in modern machine learning is crucial, and it can take various forms in algorithmic design: training set, model family, error function, regularization terms, and optimizations. In particular, the learning rate, which can be interpreted as a temperature-like parameter within the statistical mechanics of learning, plays a crucial role in neural network training. Indeed, many widely adopted training strategies basically just define the decay of the learning rate over time. This process can be interpreted as decreasing a temperature, using either a global learning rate (for the entire model) or a learning rate that varies for each parameter. This paper proposes TempBalance, a straightforward yet effective layer-wise learning rate method. TempBalance is based on Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory, an approach which characterizes the implicit self-regularization of different layers in trained models. We demonstrate the efficacy of using HT-SR-motivated metrics to guide the scheduling and balancing of temperature across all network layers during model training, resulting in improved performance during testing. We implement TempBalance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNets, VGGs, and WideResNets with various depths and widths. Our results show that TempBalance significantly outperforms ordinary SGD and carefully-tuned spectral norm regularization. We also show that TempBalance outperforms a number of state-of-the-art optimizers and learning rate schedulers.",

        "Abstract": "Partial least squares (PLS) is a dimensionality reduction technique introduced in the field of chemometrics and successfully employed in many other areas. The PLS components are obtained by maximizing the covariance between linear combinations of the regressors and of the target variables. In this work, we focus on its application to scalar regression problems. PLS regression consists in finding the least squares predictor that is a linear combination of a subset of the PLS components. Alternatively, PLS regression can be formulated as a least squares problem restricted to a Krylov subspace. This equivalent formulation is employed to analyze the distance between ${\\hat{\\boldsymbolŒ≤}\\;}_{\\mathrm{PLS}}^{\\scriptscriptstyle {(L)}}$, the PLS estimator of the vector of coefficients of the linear regression model based on $L$ PLS components, and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol Œ≤}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$, the one obtained by ordinary least squares (OLS), as a function of $L$. Specifically, ${\\hat{\\boldsymbolŒ≤}\\;}_{\\mathrm{PLS}}^{\\scriptscriptstyle {(L)}}$ is the vector of coefficients in the aforementioned Krylov subspace that is closest to $\\hat{\\boldsymbol Œ≤}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$ in terms of the Mahalanobis distance with respect to the covariance matrix of the OLS estimate. We provide a bound on this distance that depends only on the distribution of the eigenvalues of the regressor covariance matrix. Numerical examples on synthetic and real-world data are used to illustrate how the distance between ${\\hat{\\boldsymbolŒ≤}\\;}_{\\mathrm{PLS}}^{\\scriptscriptstyle {(L)}}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol Œ≤}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$ depends on the number of clusters in which the eigenvalues of the regressor covariance matrix are grouped.",

New breakthroughs in data-driven architectures and optimization techniques for fast surrogate modeling provide an exciting opportunity to overcome these limitations, enabling the use of such technology for time-critical decisions. We discuss an application to the repair of multiple stenosis in peripheral pulmonary artery disease through either transcatheter pulmonary artery rehabilitation or surgery, where it is of interest to achieve desired pressures and flows at specific locations in the pulmonary artery tree, while minimizing the risk for the patient. Since different degrees of success can be achieved in practice during treatment, we formulate the problem in probability, and solve it through a sample-based approach. We propose a new offline-online pipeline for probabilsitic real-time treatment planning which combines offline assimilation of boundary conditions, model reduction, and training dataset generation with online estimation of marginal probabilities, possibly conditioned on the degree of augmentation observed in already repaired lesions. Moreover, we propose a new approach for the parametrization of arbitrarily shaped vascular repairs through iterative corrections of a zero-dimensional approximant. We demonstrate this pipeline for a diseased model of the pulmonary artery tree available through the Vascular Model Repository.",

While global policies aim to maintain decision-making consistency and prevent arbitrary rule enforcement, they often overlook regional variations in interpreting natural language as expressed in content.

We train large language models on extensive datasets of media news and articles to create culturally attuned models. The latter aim to capture the nuances of communication across geographies with the goal of recognizing cultural and societal variations in what is considered offensive content. We further explore the capability of these models to generate explanations for instances of content violation, aiming to shed light on how policy guidelines are perceived when cultural and societal contexts change. We find that training on extensive media datasets successfully induced cultural awareness and resulted in improvements in handling content violations on a regional basis. Additionally, these advancements include the ability to provide explanations that align with the specific local norms and nuances as evidenced by the annotators' preference in our conducted study. This multifaceted success reinforces the critical role of an adaptable content moderation approach in keeping pace with the ever-evolving nature of the content it oversees.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have confirmed cardiovascular diseases remain responsible for highest death toll amongst non-communicable diseases. Accurate left ventricular (LV) volume estimation is critical for valid diagnosis and management of various cardiovascular conditions, but poses significant challenge due to inherent uncertainties associated with segmentation algorithms in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent machine learning advancements, particularly U-Net-like convolutional networks, have facilitated automated segmentation for medical images, but struggles under certain pathologies and/or different scanner vendors and imaging protocols. This study proposes a novel methodology for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in LV volume prediction using It√¥ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to model path-wise behavior for the prediction error. The model describes the area of the left ventricle along the heart's long axis. The method is agnostic to the underlying segmentation algorithm, facilitating its use with various existing and future segmentation technologies. The proposed approach provides a mechanism for quantifying uncertainty, enabling medical professionals to intervene for unreliable predictions. This is of utmost importance in critical applications such as medical diagnosis, where prediction accuracy and reliability can directly impact patient outcomes. The method is also robust to dataset changes, enabling application for medical centers with limited access to labeled data. Our findings highlight the proposed uncertainty estimation methodology's potential to enhance automated segmentation robustness and generalizability, paving the way for more reliable and accurate LV volume estimation in clinical settings as well as opening new avenues for uncertainty quantification in biomedical image segmentation, providing promising directions for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the main paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Typically, RLHF involves the initial step of learning a reward model from human feedback, often expressed as preferences between pairs of text generations produced by a pre-trained LLM. Subsequently, the LLM's policy is fine-tuned by optimizing it to maximize the reward model through a reinforcement learning algorithm. However, an inherent limitation of current reward models is their inability to fully represent the richness of human preferences and their dependency on the sampling distribution.\n  In this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning of LLMs using pairwise human feedback. Our approach entails the initial learning of a preference model, which is conditioned on two inputs given a prompt, followed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nash equilibrium of this preference model. We term this approach Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF).\n  In the context of a tabular policy representation, we present a novel algorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the principles of mirror descent. This algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iteration converging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we explore parametric representations of policies and introduce gradient descent algorithms for deep-learning architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experimental results involving the fine-tuning of a LLM for a text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenue for preference learning and policy optimization with the potential of advancing the field of aligning LLMs with human preferences.",

A dominant methodology for analyzing these network experiments has been design-based, leveraging randomization of treatment assignment as the basis for inference. In this paper, we generalize this design-based approach so that it can be applied to more complex experiments with a variety of causal estimands with different target populations. An important special case of such generalized network experiments is a bipartite network experiment, in which the treatment assignment is randomized among one set of units and the outcome is measured for a separate set of units. We propose a broad class of causal estimands based on stochastic intervention for generalized network experiments. Using a design-based approach, we show how to estimate the proposed causal quantities without bias, and develop conservative variance estimators. We apply our methodology to a randomized experiment in education where a group of selected students in middle schools are eligible for the anti-conflict promotion program, and the program participation is randomized within this group. In particular, our analysis estimates the causal effects of treating each student or his/her close friends, for different target populations in the network. We find that while the treatment improves the overall awareness against conflict among students, it does not significantly reduce the total number of conflicts.",

        "Abstract": "Gradient-based minimax optimal algorithms have greatly promoted the development of continuous optimization and machine learning. One seminal work due to Yurii Nesterov [Nes83a] established $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{L/Œº})$ gradient complexity for minimizing an $L$-smooth $Œº$-strongly convex objective. However, an ideal algorithm would adapt to the explicit complexity of a particular objective function and incur faster rates for simpler problems, triggering our reconsideration of two defeats of existing optimization modeling and analysis. (i) The worst-case optimality is neither the instance optimality nor such one in reality. (ii) Traditional $L$-smoothness condition may not be the primary abstraction/characterization for modern practical problems.\n  In this paper, we open up a new way to design and analyze gradient-based algorithms with direct applications in machine learning, including linear regression and beyond. We introduce two factors $(Œ±, œÑ_Œ±)$ to refine the description of the degenerated condition of the optimization problems based on the observation that the singular values of Hessian often drop sharply. We design adaptive algorithms that solve simpler problems without pre-known knowledge with reduced gradient or analogous oracle accesses. The algorithms also improve the state-of-art complexities for several problems in machine learning, thereby solving the open problem of how to design faster algorithms in light of the known complexity lower bounds. Specially, with the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-nuclear norm bounded, we achieve an optimal $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(Œº^{-1/3})$ (v.s. $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(Œº^{-1/2})$) gradient complexity for linear regression. We hope this work could invoke the rethinking for understanding the difficulty of modern problems in optimization.",

        "Abstract": "The partially observable constrained optimization problems (POCOPs) impede data-driven optimization techniques since an infeasible solution of POCOPs can provide little information about the objective as well as the constraints. We endeavor to design an efficient and provable method for expensive POCOPs under the framework of constrained Bayesian optimization. Our method consists of two key components. Firstly, we present an improved design of the acquisition functions that introduces balanced exploration during optimization. We rigorously study the convergence properties of this design to demonstrate its effectiveness. Secondly, we propose a Gaussian process embedding different likelihoods as the surrogate model for a partially observable constraint. This model leads to a more accurate representation of the feasible regions compared to traditional classification-based models. Our proposed method is empirically studied on both synthetic and real-world problems. The results demonstrate the competitiveness of our method for solving POCOPs.",

        "Abstract": "Major advancements in computer vision can primarily be attributed to the use of labeled datasets. However, acquiring labels for datasets often results in errors which can harm model performance. Recent works have proposed methods to automatically identify mislabeled images, but developing strategies to effectively implement them in real world datasets has been sparsely explored. Towards improved data-centric methods for cleaning real world vision datasets, we first conduct more than 200 experiments carefully benchmarking recently developed automated mislabel detection methods on multiple datasets under a variety of synthetic and real noise settings with varying noise levels. We compare these methods to a Simple and Efficient Mislabel Detector (SEMD) that we craft, and find that SEMD performs similarly to or outperforms prior mislabel detection approaches. We then apply SEMD to multiple real world computer vision datasets and test how dataset size, mislabel removal strategy, and mislabel removal amount further affect model performance after retraining on the cleaned data. With careful design of the approach, we find that mislabel removal leads per-class performance improvements of up to 8% of a retrained classifier in smaller data regimes.",

        "Abstract": "We discover a connection between the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and the recently proposed e-BH procedure [Wang and Ramdas, 2022] with a suitably defined set of e-values. This insight extends to a generalized version of the BH procedure and the model-free multiple testing procedure in Barber and Cand√®s [2015] (BC) with a general form of rejection rules. The connection provides an effective way of developing new multiple testing procedures by aggregating or assembling e-values resulting from the BH and BC procedures and their use in different subsets of the data. In particular, we propose new multiple testing methodologies in three applications, including a hybrid approach that integrates the BH and BC procedures, a multiple testing procedure aimed at ensuring a new notion of fairness by controlling both the group-wise and overall false discovery rates (FDR), and a structure adaptive multiple testing procedure that can incorporate external covariate information to boost detection power. One notable feature of the proposed methods is that we use a data-dependent approach for assigning weights to e-values, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the resulting e-BH procedure. The construction of the weights is non-trivial and is motivated by the leave-one-out analysis for the BH and BC procedures. In theory, we prove that the proposed e-BH procedures with data-dependent weights in the three applications ensure finite sample FDR control. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods through numerical studies in the three applications.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent of deep learning, progressively larger neural networks have been designed to solve complex tasks. We take advantage of these capacity-rich models to lower the cost of inference by exploiting computation in superposition. To reduce the computational burden per input, we propose Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks (MIMONets) capable of handling many inputs at once. MIMONets augment various deep neural network architectures with variable binding mechanisms to represent an arbitrary number of inputs in a compositional data structure via fixed-width distributed representations. Accordingly, MIMONets adapt nonlinear neural transformations to process the data structure holistically, leading to a speedup nearly proportional to the number of superposed input items in the data structure. After processing in superposition, an unbinding mechanism recovers each transformed input of interest. MIMONets also provide a dynamic trade-off between accuracy and throughput by an instantaneous on-demand switching between a set of accuracy-throughput operating points, yet within a single set of fixed parameters. We apply the concept of MIMONets to both CNN and Transformer architectures resulting in MIMOConv and MIMOFormer, respectively. Empirical evaluations show that MIMOConv achieves about 2-4 x speedup at an accuracy delta within [+0.68, -3.18]% compared to WideResNet CNNs on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Similarly, MIMOFormer can handle 2-4 inputs at once while maintaining a high average accuracy within a [-1.07, -3.43]% delta on the long range arena benchmark. Finally, we provide mathematical bounds on the interference between superposition channels in MIMOFormer. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/multiple-input-multiple-output-nets.",

Using valid adjustment sets determined in the generic graph, we can identify the treatment effect and build a corresponding estimator. We establish the estimator's consistency and its convergence to a Gaussian limiting distribution at the parametric rate under certain regularity conditions that restrict the growth of dependencies among units. We empirically verify the theoretical properties of our estimator through a simulation study and apply it to estimate the effect of a strict facial-mask policy on the spread of COVID-19 in Switzerland.",

        "Authors": "Yuhao Wang, Xinran Li",
        "Abstract": "Rerandomization, a design that utilizes pretreatment covariates and improves their balance between different treatment groups, has received attention recently in both theory and practice. There are at least two types of rerandomization that are used in practice: the first rerandomizes the treatment assignment until covariate imbalance is below a prespecified threshold; the second randomizes the treatment assignment multiple times and chooses the one with the best covariate balance. In this paper we will consider the second type of rerandomization, namely the best-choice rerandomization, whose theory and inference are still lacking in the literature. In particular, we will focus on the best-choice rerandomization that uses the Mahalanobis distance to measure covariate imbalance, which is one of the most commonly used imbalance measure for multivariate covariates and is invariant to affine transformations of covariates. We will study the large-sample repeatedly sampling properties of the best-choice rerandomization, allowing both the number of covariates and the number of tried complete randomizations to increase with the sample size. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the difference-in-means estimator is more concentrated around the true average treatment effect under rerandomization than under the complete randomization, and propose large-sample accurate confidence intervals for rerandomization that are shorter than that for the completely randomized experiment. We further demonstrate that, with moderate number of covariates and with the number of tried randomizations increasing polynomially with the sample size, the best-choice rerandomization can achieve the ideally optimal precision that one can expect even with perfectly balanced covariates. The developed theory and methods for rerandomization are also illustrated using real field experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Interpretability methods are critical components for examining and exploring deep neural networks (DNN), as well as increasing our understanding of and trust in them. Vision transformers (ViT), which can be trained to state-of-the-art performance with a self-supervised learning (SSL) training method, provide built-in attention maps (AM). While AMs can provide high-quality semantic segmentation of input images, they do not account for any signal coming from a downstream classifier. We introduce class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM), a novel post-hoc explanation method that is highly sensitive to the target class. Our method essentially scales attention scores by how relevant the corresponding tokens are for the predictions of a classifier head. Alternative to classifier outputs, CDAM can also explain a user-defined concept by targeting similarity measures in the latent space of the ViT. This allows for explanations of arbitrary concepts, defined by the user through a few sample images. We investigate the operating characteristics of CDAM in comparison with relevance propagation (RP) and token ablation maps (TAM), an alternative to pixel occlusion methods. CDAM is highly class-discriminative and semantically relevant, while providing implicit regularization of relevance scores.\n  PyTorch implementation: \\url{https://github.com/lenbrocki/CDAM}\n  Web live demo: \\url{https://cdam.informatism.com/}",

We provide theoretical guarantees of approximate optimality under standard assumptions, and conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation covering both synthetic as well as real-world experimental design tasks.

        "Abstract": "We address the problem of parameter estimation for degenerate diffusion processes defined via the solution of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with diffusion matrix that is not full-rank. For this class of hypo-elliptic diffusions recent works have proposed contrast estimators that are asymptotically normal, provided that the step-size in-between observations $Œî=Œî_n$ and their total number $n$ satisfy $n \\to \\infty$, $n Œî_n \\to \\infty$, $Œî_n \\to 0$, and additionally $Œî_n = o (n^{-1/2})$. This latter restriction places a requirement for a so-called `rapidly increasing experimental design'. In this paper, we overcome this limitation and develop a general contrast estimator satisfying asymptotic normality under the weaker design condition $Œî_n = o(n^{-1/p})$ for general $p \\ge 2$. Such a result has been obtained for elliptic SDEs in the literature, but its derivation in a hypo-elliptic setting is highly non-trivial. We provide numerical results to illustrate the advantages of the developed theory.",

        "Authors": "Yongqi Dong, Xingmin Lu, Ruohan Li, Wei Song, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah",
        "Abstract": "The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.",

        "Abstract": "This paper develops a general framework for stochastic modeling of goals and other events in football (soccer) matches. The events are modelled as Cox processes (doubly stochastic Poisson processes) where the event intensities may depend on all the modeled events as well as external factors. The model has a strictly concave log-likelihood function which facilitates its fitting to observed data. Besides event times, the model describes the random lengths of stoppage times which can have a strong influence on the final score of a match. The model is illustrated on eight years of data from Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol S√©rie A. We find that dynamic regressors significantly improve the in-game predictive power of the model. In particular, a) when a team receives a red card, its goal intensity decreases more than 30%; b) the goal rate of a team increases by 10% if it is losing by one goal and by 20% if its losing by two goals; and c) when the goal difference at the end of the second half is less than or equal to one, the stoppage time is on average more than one minute longer than in matches with a difference of two goals.",

        "Authors": "Chengyao Tang, Yi Zhou, Ao Huang, Satoshi Hattori",
        "Abstract": "In estimating the average treatment effect in observational studies, the influence of confounders should be appropriately addressed. To this end, the propensity score is widely used. If the propensity scores are known for all the subjects, bias due to confounders can be adjusted by using the inverse probability weighting (IPW) by the propensity score. Since the propensity score is unknown in general, it is usually estimated by the parametric logistic regression model with unknown parameters estimated by solving the score equation under the strongly ignorable treatment assignment (SITA) assumption. Violation of the SITA assumption and/or misspecification of the propensity score model can cause serious bias in estimating the average treatment effect. To relax the SITA assumption, the IPW estimator based on the outcome-dependent propensity score has been successfully introduced. However, it still depends on the correctly specified parametric model and its identification. In this paper, we propose a simple sensitivity analysis method for unmeasured confounders. In the standard practice, the estimating equation is used to estimate the unknown parameters in the parametric propensity score model. Our idea is to make inference on the average causal effect by removing restrictive parametric model assumptions while still utilizing the estimating equation. Using estimating equations as constraints, which the true propensity scores asymptotically satisfy, we construct the worst-case bounds for the average treatment effect with linear programming. Different from the existing sensitivity analysis methods, we construct the worst-case bounds with minimal assumptions. We illustrate our proposal by simulation studies and a real-world example.",

In this article, we conduct causal inference under interference on an observed, sparse but connected network, and we propose a novel design of experiments based on an independent set. Compared to conventional designs, the independent-set design focuses on an independent subset of data and controls their interference exposures through the assignments to the rest (auxiliary set). We provide a lower bound on the size of the independent set from a greedy algorithm , and justify the theoretical performance of estimators under the proposed design. Our approach is capable of estimating both spillover effects and treatment effects. We justify its superiority over conventional methods and illustrate the empirical performance through simulations.",

In this context, it is crucial to propagate the uncertainty induced by limited simulation budget and surrogate approximation error to predictions, inference, and subsequent decision-relevant quantities. However, quantifying and then propagating the uncertainty of surrogates is usually limited to special analytic cases or is otherwise computationally very expensive. In this paper, we propose a framework enabling a scalable, Bayesian approach to surrogate modeling with thorough uncertainty quantification, propagation, and validation. Specifically, we present three methods for Bayesian inference with surrogate models given measurement data. This is a task where the propagation of surrogate uncertainty is especially relevant, because failing to account for it may lead to biased and/or overconfident estimates of the parameters of interest. We showcase our approach in two detailed case studies for both linear and nonlinear modeling scenarios. Uncertainty propagation in surrogate models enables more reliable and safe approximation of expensive simulators and will therefore be useful in various fields of applications.",

Unlike the classic least squares which treats every squared residual equally important, the new procedure exponentially down-weights squared-residuals that lie far away from the cloud of all residuals and assigns a constant weight (one) to squared-residuals that lie close to the center of the squared-residual cloud.\n  The new procedure can keep a good balance between robustness and efficiency, it possesses the highest breakdown point robustness for any regression equivariant procedure, much more robust than the classic least squares, yet much more efficient than the benchmark of robust method, the least trimmed squares (LTS) of Rousseeuw (1984).\n  With a smooth weight function, the new procedure could be computed very fast by the first-order (first-derivative) method and the second-order (second-derivative) method.\n  Assertions and other theoretical findings are verified in simulated and real data examples.",

        "Abstract": "The least squares of depth trimmed (LST) residuals regression, proposed in Zuo and Zuo (2023) \\cite{ZZ23}, serves as a robust alternative to the classic least squares (LS) regression as well as a strong competitor to the famous least trimmed squares (LTS) regression of Rousseeuw (1984) \\cite{R84}. Theoretical properties of the LST were thoroughly studied in \\cite{ZZ23}.\n  The article aims to promote the implementation and computation of the LST residuals regression for a broad group of statisticians in statistical practice and demonstrates that (i) the LST is as robust as the benchmark of robust regression, the LTS regression, and much more efficient than the latter. (ii) It can be as efficient as (or even more efficient than) the LS in the scenario with errors uncorrelated with mean zero and homoscedastic with finite variance. (iii) It can be computed as fast as (or even faster than) the LTS based on a newly proposed algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "Large-scale discrete fracture network (DFN) simulators are standard fare for studies involving the sub-surface transport of particles since direct observation of real world underground fracture networks is generally infeasible. While these simulators have seen numerous successes over several engineering applications, estimations on quantities of interest (QoI) - such as breakthrough time of particles reaching the edge of the system - suffer from a two distinct types of uncertainty. A run of a DFN simulator requires several parameter values to be set that dictate the placement and size of fractures, the density of fractures, and the overall permeability of the system; uncertainty on the proper parameter choices will lead to some amount of uncertainty in the QoI, called epistemic uncertainty. Furthermore, since DFN simulators rely on stochastic processes to place fractures and govern flow, understanding how this randomness affects the QoI requires several runs of the simulator at distinct random seeds. The uncertainty in the QoI attributed to different realizations (i.e. different seeds) of the same random process leads to a second type of uncertainty, called aleatoric uncertainty. In this paper, we perform a Sensitivity Analysis, which directly attributes the uncertainty observed in the QoI to the epistemic uncertainty from each input parameter and to the aleatoric uncertainty. We make several design choices to handle an observed heteroskedasticity in DFN simulators, where the aleatoric uncertainty changes for different inputs, since the quality makes several standard statistical methods inadmissible. Beyond the specific takeaways on which input variables affect uncertainty the most for DFN simulators, a major contribution of this paper is the introduction of a statistically rigorous workflow for characterizing the uncertainty in DFN flow simulations that exhibit heteroskedasticity.",

        "Authors": "Max Hahn-Klimroth, Paul W. Dierkes, Matthias W. Kleespies",
        "Abstract": "In several branches of the social sciences and humanities, surveys based on standardized questionnaires are a prominent research tool. While there are a variety of ways to analyze the data, some standard procedures have become established. When those surveys want to analyze differences in the answer patterns of different groups (e.g., countries, gender, age, ...), these procedures can only be carried out in a meaningful way if there is measurement invariance, i.e., the measured construct has psychometric equivalence across groups. As recently raised as an open problem by Sauerwein et al. (2021), new evaluation methods that work in the absence of measurement invariance are needed.\n  This paper promotes an unsupervised learning-based approach to such research data by proposing a procedure that works in three phases: data preparation, clustering of questionnaires, and measuring similarity based on the obtained clustering and the properties of each group. We generate synthetic data in three data sets, which allows us to compare our approach with the PCA approach under measurement invariance and under violated measurement invariance. As a main result, we obtain that the approach provides a natural comparison between groups and a natural description of the response patterns of the groups. Moreover, it can be safely applied to a wide variety of data sets, even in the absence of measurement invariance. Finally, this approach allows us to translate (violations of) measurement invariance into a meaningful measure of similarity.",

        "Abstract": "Exact methods for exponentiation of matrices of dimension $N$ can be computationally expensive in terms of execution time ($N^{3}$) and memory requirements ($N^{2}$) not to mention numerical precision issues. A type of matrix often exponentiated in the sciences is the rate matrix. Here we explore five methods to exponentiate rate matrices some of which apply even more broadly to other matrix types. Three of the methods leverage a mathematical analogy between computing matrix elements of a matrix exponential and computing transition probabilities of a dynamical processes (technically a Markov jump process, MJP, typically simulated using Gillespie). In doing so, we identify a novel MJP-based method relying on restricting the number of ``trajectory\" jumps based on the magnitude of the matrix elements with favorable computational scaling. We then discuss this method's downstream implications on mixing properties of Monte Carlo posterior samplers. We also benchmark two other methods of matrix exponentiation valid for any matrix (beyond rate matrices and, more generally, positive definite matrices) related to solving differential equations: Runge-Kutta integrators and Krylov subspace methods. Under conditions where both the largest matrix element and the number of non-vanishing elements scale linearly with $N$ -- reasonable conditions for rate matrices often exponentiated -- computational time scaling with the most competitive methods (Krylov and one of the MJP-based methods) reduces to $N^2$ with total memory requirements of $N$.",

        "Abstract": "Creativity is core to being human. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on GenAI ideas. We study the causal impact of GenAI ideas on the production of an unstructured creative output in an online experimental study where some writers could obtain ideas for a story from a GenAI platform. We find that access to GenAI ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, objective measures of story similarity within each condition reveal that GenAI-enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity, but at the same time there is a risk of losing collective novelty: this dynamic resembles a social dilemma where individual writers are better off using GenAI to improve their own writing, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content may be produced with GenAI. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity, but point to potential downstream consequences from over-reliance.",

Simple discrete-data hazard models can be expressed as binary choice panel data models, and the widespread Prentice and Gloeckler (1978) discrete-data proportional hazards model can specifically be expressed as a complementary log-log model with time fixed effects. This allows me to recast it as GMM estimation and its instrumented version as sequential GMM estimation in a Z-estimation (non-classical GMM) framework; this framework can then be leveraged to establish asymptotic properties and sufficient conditions. Whilst this paper focuses on the Prentice and Gloeckler (1978) model, the methods and discussion developed here can be applied more generally to other hazard models and binary choice models. I also introduce my Stata command for estimating a complementary log-log model instrumented via control functions (available as ivcloglog on SSC), which allows practitioners to easily instrument the Prentice and Gloeckler (1978) model.",

        "Authors": "Rafael Andersson Lipcsey",
        "Abstract": "This thesis aims to assess the importance of the air transport sector for Sweden's economy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two complementary research goals are formulated. Firstly, investigating economic linkages of the Swedish air transport sector. Secondly, estimating the effects of the pandemic on Swedish air transport, and the spin-off effects on the economy as a whole. Overview of literature in the field reveals that while a fair amount of research exists on the importance of air transport, unsurprisingly, pandemic effects have yet to be investigated. The methodological framework chosen is input-output analysis, thus, the backbone of data materials used is the Swedish input-output table, complemented by additional datasets. For measuring economic linkages, basic input-output analysis is applied. Meanwhile, to capture the pandemic's impacts, a combination of inoperability analysis and the partial hypothetical extraction model is implemented. It is found that while Swedish air transport plays an important role in turning the cogs of the Swedish economy, when compared to all other sectors, it ranks on the lower end. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental short-term impact on Swedish air transport, the spin-off effects for the economy as a whole are milder. It is concluded, that out of a value-added perspective, the Swedish government, and by extension policy makers globally need not support failing airlines, and other air transport actors. Nonetheless, some aspects could not be captured through the methods used, such as the possible importance of airlines to national security at times of dodgy global cooperation. Lastly, to accurately capture not only short-term, but also long-term effects of the pandemic, future research using alternative, causality-based frameworks and dynamic input-output models will be highly beneficial.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of units with extreme values in the dependent and/or independent variables (i.e., vertical outliers, leveraged data) has the potential to severely bias regression coefficients and/or standard errors. This is common with short panel data because the researcher cannot advocate asymptotic theory. Example include cross-country studies, cell-group analyses, and field or laboratory experimental studies, where the researcher is forced to use few cross-sectional observations repeated over time due to the structure of the data or research design. Available diagnostic tools may fail to properly detect these anomalies, because they are not designed for panel data. In this paper, we formalise statistical measures for panel data models with fixed effects to quantify the degree of leverage and outlyingness of units, and the joint and conditional influences of pairs of units. We first develop a method to visually detect anomalous units in a panel data set, and identify their type. Second, we investigate the effect of these units on LS estimates, and on other units' influence on the estimated parameters. To illustrate and validate the proposed method, we use a synthetic data set contaminated with different types of anomalous units. We also provide an empirical example.",

In this note, we introduce a novel framework that naturally separates social preferences from selfish preferences to answer the following question: What specific forms of social preferences can be accommodated within the expected utility paradigm? In a departure from existing frameworks, our framework reveals that ex ante social preferences are not inherently in conflict with expected utility in games, provided a decision-maker's aversion to randomization in selfish utility \"counterbalances\" her social preference for randomization. We also show that when a player's preferences in both the game (against another player) and the associated decision problem (against Nature) conform to expected utility axioms, the permissible range of social preferences becomes notably restricted. Only under this condition do we reaffirm the existing literature's key insight regarding the incompatibility of ex ante inequality aversion with expected utility.",

We weigh gridded climate data by population density or by night light intensity -- both proxies of economic activity -- before aggregation. Climate variables are measured daily, monthly, and annually, covering (depending on the data source) a time window from 1900 (at the earliest) to 2023. We pipeline all the preprocessing procedures in a unified framework, which we share in the open-access Weighted Climate Data Repository web app. Finally, we validate our data through a systematic comparison with those employed in leading climate impact studies.",

Unfortunately, their analysis suffered from major flaws in the choice of underlying data, resulting in poorly matched and unstable counterfactual scenarios. These were compounded by calculation errors, biasing the study against finding that projects significantly reduced deforestation. This flawed analysis of 24 projects unfairly condemned all 100+ REDD projects, and risks cutting off finance for protecting vulnerable tropical forests from destruction at a time when funding needs to grow rapidly.",

How to rank assessors and attributes' evaluations based on (in)consistency? Who can be considered an (in)consistent assessor? What is the difference between consistent and inconsistent assessors' evaluations and use of scale? What is the impact of consistent and inconsistent assessors' evaluations on the overall liking estimate? The proposed detection of (in)consistency requires evaluations on two connected scales. We reveal how assessors and attributes can be ranked according to the level of inconsistency, as well as how inconsistent assessors can be identified.

Future consumer tests are recommended to account for possible inconsistent evaluations.",

        "Authors": "Lidia Cano Pecharroman, ChangHoon Hahn",
        "Abstract": "As governments race to implement new climate adaptation policies that prepare for more frequent flooding, they must seek policies that are effective for all communities and uphold climate justice. This requires evaluating policies not only on their overall effectiveness but also on whether their benefits are felt across all communities. We illustrate the importance of considering such disparities for flood adaptation using the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program Community Rating System and its dataset of $\\sim$2.5 million flood insurance claims. We use ${\\rm C{\\scriptsize AUSAL}F{\\scriptsize LOW}}$, a causal inference method based on deep generative models, to estimate the treatment effect of flood adaptation interventions based on a community's income, diversity, population, flood risk, educational attainment, and precipitation. We find that the program saves communities \\$5,000--15,000 per household. However, these savings are not evenly spread across communities. For example, for low-income communities savings sharply decline as flood-risk increases in contrast to their high-income counterparts with all else equal. Even among low-income communities, there is a gap in savings between predominantly white and non-white communities: savings of predominantly white communities can be higher by more than \\$6000 per household. As communities worldwide ramp up efforts to reduce losses inflicted by floods, simply prescribing a series flood adaptation measures is not enough. Programs must provide communities with the necessary technical and economic support to compensate for historical patterns of disenfranchisement, racism, and inequality. Future flood adaptation efforts should go beyond reducing losses overall and aim to close existing gaps to equitably support communities in the race for climate adaptation.",

While this problem has attracted significant attention in recent years, the incentives for voters to participate in an election for a given ABC voting rule have been neglected so far. This paper is thus the first to explicitly study this property, typically called participation, for ABC voting rules. In particular, we show that all ABC scoring rules even satisfy group participation, whereas most sequential rules severely fail participation. We furthermore explore several escape routes to the impossibility for sequential ABC voting rules: we prove for many sequential rules that (i) they satisfy participation on laminar profiles, (ii) voters who approve none of the elected candidates cannot benefit by abstaining, and (iii) it is NP-hard for a voter to decide whether she benefits from abstaining.",

        "Authors": "Stefano Bianchini, Moritz M√ºller, Pierre Pelletier",
        "Abstract": "New technologies have the power to revolutionize science. It has happened in the past and is happening again with the emergence of new computational tools, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Despite the documented impact of these technologies, there remains a significant gap in understanding the process of their adoption within the scientific community. In this paper, we draw on theories of scientific and technical human capital (STHC) to study the integration of AI in scientific research, focusing on the human capital of scientists and the external resources available within their network of collaborators and institutions. We validate our hypotheses on a large sample of publications from OpenAlex, covering all sciences from 1980 to 2020. We find that the diffusion of AI is strongly driven by social mechanisms that organize the deployment and creation of human capital that complements the technology. Our results suggest that AI is pioneered by domain scientists with a `taste for exploration' and who are embedded in a network rich of computer scientists, experienced AI scientists and early-career researchers; they also come from institutions with high citation impact and a relatively strong publication history on AI. The pattern is similar across scientific disciplines, the exception being access to high-performance computing (HPC), which is important in chemistry and the medical sciences but less so in other fields. Once AI is integrated into research, most adoption factors continue to influence its subsequent reuse. Implications for the organization and management of science in the evolving era of AI-driven discovery are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Algorithmic monoculture arises when many decision-makers rely on the same algorithm to evaluate applicants. An emerging body of work investigates possible harms of this kind of homogeneity, but has been limited by the challenge of incorporating market effects in which the preferences and behavior of many applicants and decision-makers jointly interact to determine outcomes.\n  Addressing this challenge, we introduce a tractable theoretical model of algorithmic monoculture in a two-sided matching market with many participants. We use the model to analyze outcomes under monoculture (when decision-makers all evaluate applicants using a common algorithm) and under polyculture (when decision-makers evaluate applicants independently). All else equal, monoculture (1) selects less-preferred applicants when noise is well-behaved, (2) matches more applicants to their top choice, though individual applicants may be worse off depending on their value to decision-makers and risk tolerance, and (3) is more robust to disparities in the number of applications submitted.",

How do we ascribe subjective probability to agents which do not satisfy these strong rationality assumptions? I present a representation theorem with weak rationality assumptions which can be used to define or measure subjective probability for partly irrational agents.",

We develop statistical inference on the number of common stochastic trends that are embedded in the time series, i.e., the dimension of the nonstationary subspace. We also consider hypotheses on the nonstationary subspace itself. The Hilbert space can be of an arbitrarily large dimension, and our methods remain asymptotically valid even when the time series of interest takes values in a subspace of possibly unknown dimension. This has wide applicability in practice; for example, to the case of cointegrated vector time series that are either high-dimensional or of finite dimension, to high-dimensional factor model that includes a finite number of nonstationary factors, to cointegrated curve-valued (or function-valued) time series, and to nonstationary dynamic functional factor models. We include two empirical illustrations to the term structure of interest rates and labor market indices, respectively.",

There are many business processes within the port activity that can be improved through the use of more efficient technologies and BPMS in particular, which can help to coordinate and automate critical processes such as cargo manifests, customs declaration the management of scales, or dangerous goods, traditionally supported by EDI technologies. These technologies could be integrated with BPMS, modernizing port logistics management. The aim of this work is to demonstrate, through a systematic analysis of the literature, the state of the art in BPMS research in the port industry. For this, a systematic review of the literature of the last ten years was carried out. The works generated by the search were subsequently analysed and filtered. After the investigation, it is discovered that the relationship between BPMS and the port sector is practically non-existent which represents an important gap to be covered and a future line of research.",

While dynamic asymmetry may capture the likely direction of future asset returns, it comes at the risk of leading to overparameterization. Our proposed approach mitigates this concern by leveraging sparsity-inducing priors to automatically selects the skewness parameter as being dynamic, static or zero in a data-driven framework. We consider two empirical applications. First, in a bond yield application, dynamic skewness captures interest rate cycles of monetary easing and tightening being partially explained by central banks' mandates. In an currency modeling framework, our model indicates no skewness in the carry factor after accounting for stochastic volatility which supports the idea of carry crashes being the result of volatility surges instead of dynamic skewness.",

        "Authors": "Alicia Martin-Navarro, Felix Velicia-Martin, Jose Aurelio Medina-Garrido, Ricardo Gouveia Rodrigues",
        "Abstract": "The tourism sector is a sector with many opportunities for business development. Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job creation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its transformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can adopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering the causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way, entrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and analysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies causal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative innovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the entrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious gap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the entrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity, proactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour influence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we analysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities in southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation methodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results show, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship learning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in the field of entrepreneurial intentions. Considering propensity towards causal behaviour before setting up the firm is unprecedented. Furthermore, the results of this study have practical implications for the design of public education policies and the promotion of business creation in the tourism sector.",

Each step consists of two stages: the agents first update their position in the opinion metric space by a local barycenter characterized by the agents' immediate interactions and then a moderator makes a proposal in terms of a global barycenter, checking for consensus at each step. In cases of large heterogeneous groups the procedure can be complemented by an auxiliary initial homogenization step, consisting of a clustering procedure in opinion space, leading to large homogeneous groups for which the aforementioned procedure will be applied.\n  The scheme is illustrated in examples motivated from environmental economics.",

We employed a discrete-choice framework of airline route entry to examine the effects of the merger of another regional carrier, Trip Airlines, with Azul in 2012, especially on its entry decisions. We contrasted the estimated entry determinants before and after the merger with the benchmarks of the US carriers JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines obtained from the literature, and proposed a methodology for comparing different airline entry patterns by utilizing the kappa statistic for interrater agreement. Our empirical results indicate a statistically significant agreement between raters of Azul and JetBlue, but not Southwest, and only for entries on previously existing routes during the pre-merger period. The results suggest that post-merger, Azul has adopted a more idiosyncratic entry pattern, focusing on the regional flights segment to conquer many monopoly positions across the country, and strengthening its profitability without compromising its distinguished expansion pace in the industry.",

        "Authors": "Takeshi Kato",
        "Abstract": "Reducing wealth inequality and disparity is a global challenge. The economic system is mainly divided into (1) gift and reciprocity, (2) power and redistribution, (3) market exchange, and (4) mutual aid without reciprocal obligations. The current inequality stems from a capitalist economy consisting of (2) and (3). To sublimate (1), which is the human economy, to (4), the concept of a \"mixbiotic society\" has been proposed in the philosophical realm. This is a society in which free and diverse individuals, \"I,\" mix with each other, recognize their respective \"fundamental incapability\" and sublimate them into \"WE\" solidarity. The economy in this society must have moral responsibility as a coadventurer and consideration for vulnerability to risk. Therefore, I focus on two factors of mind perception: moral responsibility and risk vulnerability, and propose a novel model of wealth distribution following an econophysical approach. Specifically, I developed a joint-venture model, a redistribution model in the joint-venture model, and a \"WE economy\" model. A simulation comparison of a combination of the joint ventures and redistribution with the WE economies reveals that WE economies are effective in reducing inequality and resilient in normalizing wealth distribution as advantages, and susceptible to free riders as disadvantages. However, this disadvantage can be compensated for by fostering consensus and fellowship, and by complementing it with joint ventures. This study essentially presents the effectiveness of moral responsibility, the complementarity between the WE economy and the joint economy, and the direction of the economy toward reducing inequality. Future challenges are to develop the WE economy model based on real economic analysis and psychology, as well as to promote WE economy fieldwork for worker coops and platform cooperatives to realize a desirable mixbiotic society.",

        "Abstract": "Using only 34 published tables, we reconstruct five variables (census block, sex, age, race, and ethnicity) in the confidential 2010 Census person records. Using the 38-bin age variable tabulated at the census block level, at most 20.1% of reconstructed records can differ from their confidential source on even a single value for these five variables. Using only published data, an attacker can verify that all records in 70% of all census blocks (97 million people) are perfectly reconstructed. The tabular publications in Summary File 1 thus have prohibited disclosure risk similar to the unreleased confidential microdata. Reidentification studies confirm that an attacker can, within blocks with perfect reconstruction accuracy, correctly infer the actual census response on race and ethnicity for 3.4 million vulnerable population uniques (persons with nonmodal characteristics) with 95% accuracy, the same precision as the confidential data achieve and far greater than statistical baselines. The flaw in the 2010 Census framework was the assumption that aggregation prevented accurate microdata reconstruction, justifying weaker disclosure limitation methods than were applied to 2010 Census public microdata. The framework used for 2020 Census publications defends against attacks that are based on reconstruction, as we also demonstrate here. Finally, we show that alternatives to the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System with similar accuracy (enhanced swapping) also fail to protect confidentiality, and those that partially defend against reconstruction attacks (incomplete suppression implementations) destroy the primary statutory use case: data for redistricting all legislatures in the country in compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.",

It shows that information asymmetry between the seller and buyer may result in market collapse or some sellers leaving the market. \"Lemons\" in the used car market are cars of poor quality. The information asymmetry present is that the buyer is uncertain of the cars' true quality. I first offer a simple baseline model that illustrates the market collapse, and then examine what happens when regulation, ie. a DMV is introduced to reveal (signal) the true car quality to the buyer. The effect on the market varies based on the assumptions about the regulator. The central focus is on the DMV's signal structure, which can have interesting effects on the market and the information asymmetry. I show that surprisingly, when the DMV actually decreases the quality of their signal in a well constructed way, it can substantially increase their profit. On the other hand, this negatively effects overall welfare.",

        "Abstract": "Decarbonizing China's energy system requires both greening the power supply and end-use electrification. While the latter speeds up with the electric vehicle adoption, a rapid power sector transformation can be technologically and institutionally challenging. Using an integrated assessment model, we analyze the synergy between power sector decarbonization and end-use electrification in China's net-zero pathway from a system perspective. We show that even with a slower coal power phase-out, reaching a high electrification rate of 60% by 2050 is a robust optimal strategy. Comparing emission intensity of typical end-use applications, we find most have reached parity with incumbent fossil fuel technologies even under China's current power mix due to efficiency gains. Since a 10-year delay in coal power phase-out can result in an additional cumulative emission of 28% (4%) of the global 1.5¬∞C (2¬∞C) CO2 budget, policy measures should be undertaken today to ensure a power sector transition without unexpected delays.",

        "Authors": "Dandan Qiao, Huaxia Rui, Qian Xiong",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or software to mimic or even surpass human intelligence in a given cognitive task. While humans learn by both induction and deduction, the success of current AI is rooted in induction, relying on its ability to detect statistical regularities in task input -- an ability learnt from a vast amount of training data using enormous computation resources. We examine the performance of such a statistical AI in a human task through the lens of four factors, including task learnability, statistical resource, computation resource, and learning techniques, and then propose a three-phase visual framework to understand the evolving relation between AI and jobs. Based on this conceptual framework, we develop a simple economic model of competition to show the existence of an inflection point for each occupation. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human workers always benefit from an improvement in AI performance, but after the inflection point, human workers become worse off whenever such an improvement occurs. To offer empirical evidence, we first argue that AI performance has passed the inflection point for the occupation of translation but not for the occupation of web development. We then study how the launch of ChatGPT, which led to significant improvement of AI performance on many tasks, has affected workers in these two occupations on a large online labor platform. Consistent with the inflection point conjecture, we find that translators are negatively affected by the shock both in terms of the number of accepted jobs and the earnings from those jobs, while web developers are positively affected by the very same shock. Given the potentially large disruption of AI on employment, more studies on more occupations using data from different platforms are urgently needed.",

Each decision is modeled as a menu of actions with outcomes, and a stochastic choice rule assigns probabilities to actions based on the outcome profile. Outcomes can be monetary values, lotteries, or elements of an abstract outcome space. We characterize decomposable rules: those that predict independent choices across decisions not affecting each other. For monetary outcomes, such rules form the one-parametric family of multinomial logit rules. For general outcomes, there exists a universal utility function on the set of outcomes, such that choice follows multinomial logit with respect to this utility. The conclusions are robust to replacing strict decomposability with an approximate version or allowing minor dependencies on the actions' labels. Applications include choice over time, under risk, and with ambiguity.",

With the advent of Airbnb's new pricing tool, this research explores how digital tools influence hosts' pricing strategies, potentially leading to market dynamics that straddle the line between efficiency and collusion. Utilizing a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), the study examines the causal effects of the pricing tool on pricing behavior among hosts with different operational strategies. The findings aim to provide insights into the evolving landscape of digital economies, examining the balance between competitive market practices and the risk of tacit collusion facilitated by algorithmic pricing. This study contributes to the discourse on digital market regulation, offering a nuanced understanding of the implications of AI-driven tools in market dynamics and antitrust analysis.",

We study this question in a model where heterogeneous agents in terms of knowledge--humans and machines--endogenously sort into hierarchical teams: Less knowledgeable agents become \"workers\" (i.e., execute routine tasks), while more knowledgeable agents become \"managers\" (i.e., specialize in problem solving). When AI's knowledge is equivalent to that of a pre-AI worker, AI displaces humans from routine work into managerial work compared to the pre-AI outcome. In contrast, when AI's knowledge is that of a pre-AI manager, it shifts humans from managerial work to routine work. AI increases total human labor income, but it necessarily creates winners and losers: When AI's knowledge is low, only the most knowledgeable humans experience income gains. In contrast, when AI's knowledge is high, both extremes of the knowledge distribution benefit. In any case, the introduction of AI harms the middle class.",

        "Abstract": "To address the bias of the canonical two-way fixed effects estimator for difference-in-differences under staggered adoptions, Wooldridge (2021) proposed the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, which adds many parameters. However, this reduces efficiency. Restricting some of these parameters to be equal helps, but ad hoc restrictions may reintroduce bias. We propose a machine learning estimator with a single tuning parameter, fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE), that enables automatic data-driven selection of these restrictions. We prove that under an appropriate sparsity assumption FETWFE identifies the correct restrictions with probability tending to one. We also prove the consistency, asymptotic normality, and oracle efficiency of FETWFE for two classes of heterogeneous marginal treatment effect estimators under either conditional or marginal parallel trends, and we prove consistency for two classes of conditional average treatment effects under conditional parallel trends. We demonstrate FETWFE in simulation studies and an empirical application.",

Discounting future benefits and costs of climate change mitigation is one of the most important components of assessing efficient climate mitigation pathways. We extend the DICE model with stochastic discount rates to reflect the dynamic nature of discount rates. Stochastic rates give rise to a mitigation strategy, resulting in all model quantities becoming stochastic. We show that the classical calibration of the DICE model induces intergenerational inequality: future generations have to bear higher costs relative to GDP and that this effect worsens under stochastic discount rates. Accounting for additional financing risks, we investigate two modifications of DICE. We find that allowing financing of abatement costs and considering non-linear financing effects for large damages improves intergenerational effort sharing. We propose a modified optimisation to keep costs below 3\\% of GDP, resulting in more equal efforts between generations.",

        "Authors": "Paul Clarke, Annalivia Polselli",
        "Abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are powerful data-driven tools for approximating high-dimensional or non-linear nuisance functions which are useful in practice because the true functional form of the predictors is ex-ante unknown. In this paper, we develop estimators of policy interventions from panel data which allow for non-linear effects of the confounding regressors, and investigate the performance of these estimators using three well-known ML algorithms, specifically, LASSO, classification and regression trees, and random forests. We use Double Machine Learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) for the estimation of causal effects of homogeneous treatments with unobserved individual heterogeneity (fixed effects) and no unobserved confounding by extending Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model. We develop three alternative approaches for handling unobserved individual heterogeneity based on extending the within-group estimator, first-difference estimator, and correlated random effect estimator (Mundlak, 1978) for non-linear models. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find that conventional least squares estimators can perform well even if the data generating process is non-linear, but there are substantial performance gains in terms of bias reduction under a process where the true effect of the regressors is non-linear and discontinuous. However, for the same scenarios, we also find -- despite extensive hyperparameter tuning -- inference to be problematic for both tree-based learners because these lead to highly non-normal estimator distributions and the estimator variance being severely under-estimated. This contradicts the performance of trees in other circumstances and requires further investigation. Finally, we provide an illustrative example of DML for observational panel data showing the impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage in the UK.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of the update of subjective homicide victimization risk after an informational shock by developing two econometric models able to accommodate both optimal decisions of changing prior expectations which enable us to rationalize skeptical Bayesian agents with their disregard to new information. We apply our models to a unique household data (N = 4,030) that consists of socioeconomic and victimization expectation variables in Brazil, coupled with an informational ``natural experiment'' brought by the sample design methodology, which randomized interviewers to interviewees. The higher priors about their own subjective homicide victimization risk are set, the more likely individuals are to change their initial perceptions. In case of an update, we find that elders and females are more reluctant to change priors and choose the new response level. In addition, even though the respondents' level of education is not significant, the interviewers' level of education has a key role in changing and updating decisions. The results show that our econometric approach fits reasonable well the available empirical evidence, stressing the salient role heterogeneity represented by individual characteristics of interviewees and interviewers have on belief updating and lack of it, say, skepticism. Furthermore, we can rationalize skeptics through an informational quality/credibility argument.",

While the intuitive benefits of using covariate ranks for matching estimation are apparent, there is no theoretical understanding of such procedures in the literature. We fill this gap by demonstrating that Rosenbaum's rank-based matching estimator, when coupled with a regression adjustment, enjoys the properties of double robustness and semiparametric efficiency without the need to enforce restrictive covariate moment assumptions. Our theoretical findings further emphasize the statistical virtues of employing ranks for estimation and inference, more broadly aligning with the insights put forth by Peter Bickel in his 2004 Rietz lecture (Bickel, 2004).",

We develop a portfolio selection model based on the Half-Full/Half-Empty strategy, resulting in a nonconvex optimization problem, which, nonetheless, is proven to be equivalent to an alternative Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation. By means of the ensuing empirical analysis, based on three real-world datasets, the Half-Full/Half-Empty model is shown to be very versatile by appropriately varying its parameters, and to provide portfolios displaying promising performances in terms of risk and profitability, compared with Prospect Theory, risk minimization approaches and Equally-Weighted portfolios.",

Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $Œ±.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $Œ±= 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Carbon abatement decisions are usually based on the implausible assumption of constant social preference. This paper focuses on a specific case of market and non-market goods, and investigates the optimal climate policy when social preference for them is also changed by climate policy in the DICE model. The relative price of non-market goods grows over time due to increases in both relative scarcity and appreciation of it. Therefore, climbing relative price brings upward the social cost of carbon denominated in terms of market goods. Because abatement decision affects the valuation of non-market goods in the utility function, unlike previous climate-economy models, we solve the model iteratively by taking the obtained abatement rates from the last run as inputs in the current run. The results in baseline calibration advocate a more stringent climate policy, where endogenous social preference to climate policy raises the social cost of carbon further by roughly 12%-18% this century. Moreover, neglecting changing social preference leads to an underestimate of non-market goods damages by 15%. Our results support that climate policy is self-reinforced if it favors more expensive consumption type.",

We study the identification of treatment effects and illustrate the presence of a trade-off between time and unit-level confounding. We provide asymptotic results for inference for several Synthetic Control estimators and show that different sources of randomness should be considered for inference, depending on the nature of confounding.

Many related panel methods have a similar limitation when the number of units is fixed. I introduce and evaluate a new method in which the Synthetic Control is constructed using a General Method of Moments approach where if the Synthetic Control satisfies the moment conditions it must have the same loadings on latent factors as the treated unit. I show that a Synthetic Control Estimator of this form will be asymptotically unbiased as the number of pre-treatment time periods goes to infinity, even when pre-treatment fit is imperfect and the set of controls is fixed. Furthermore, if both the number of pre-treatment and post-treatment time periods go to infinity, then averages of treatment effects can be consistently estimated and asymptotically valid inference can be conducted using a subsampling method. I conduct simulations and an empirical application to compare the performance of this method with existing approaches in the literature.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous studies use regression discontinuity design (RDD) for panel data by assuming that the treatment effects are homogeneous across all individuals/groups and pooling the data together. It is unclear how to test for the significance of treatment effects when the treatments vary across individuals/groups and the error terms may exhibit complicated dependence structures. This paper examines the estimation and inference of multiple treatment effects when the errors are not independent and identically distributed, and the treatment effects vary across individuals/groups. We derive a simple analytical expression for approximating the variance-covariance structure of the treatment effect estimators under general dependence conditions and propose two test statistics, one is to test for the overall significance of the treatment effect and the other for the homogeneity of the treatment effects. We find that in the Gaussian approximations to the test statistics, the dependence structures in the data can be safely ignored due to the localized nature of the statistics. This has the important implication that the simulated critical values can be easily obtained. Simulations demonstrate our tests have superb size control and reasonable power performance in finite samples regardless of the presence of strong cross-section dependence or/and weak serial dependence in the data. We apply our tests to two datasets and find significant overall treatment effects in each case.",
